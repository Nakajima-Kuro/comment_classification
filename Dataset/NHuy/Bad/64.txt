Don’t even bother!!
I came to Vinpearl for my 22nd birthday hoping to make some awesome memories. But it was so horrible we went home early and ended up wasting so much money on our ticket. The regular park had only a couple of rides and the workers were very slow and inefficient as they need to be train much better at how to be more efficient. The water park was the worst part yet! We witness adults and kids falling off their tubes going down a slide! One kid bit his lip and his parents were pissed but couldn’t communicate. The slides were simply not safe and didn’t have enough water. The park is so tiny to be charging people so much $!
