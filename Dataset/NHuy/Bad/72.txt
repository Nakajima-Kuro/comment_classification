A waist of time
We came with our 4 kids. There were only a few facilities which were intresting, and most of them had a very long line, so we gave up.
For our young doughter there were even less things to do - some were not working and most of them were not suitable for her hight (she is 5 years old, and they reqwested 130cm hight).
We went back after short time couse it was hot and boring.
A wast of time and money !
