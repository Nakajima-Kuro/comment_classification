Zipline
We waited in que to buy a ticket to the zip. Come in front and we had to pic a card. I didnt get a ticket but mye girlfriend did. So i offered me to pay for one, but we could't. So that ment that i had to sis for a long time alone and let my girlfriend travel up there alone and experience it whitout med. So stupid! And right behind us there was a group of 3, and only one of them got a ticket. So he gave it to me. And when i showed them the ticket they just said no and could not explain them self. So bad english here! Just plain stupid. Just destroyed the whole trip here. Whriting this at the moment im waiting for my girl to zip down. 45min and still counting... What a waste of time!
