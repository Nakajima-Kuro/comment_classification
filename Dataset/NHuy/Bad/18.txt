Too crowded and nothing interesting
We arrived at the cave with at least a dozen other junks. Then we were 'guided' through the big but completely unspectacular cave. There are so many people stuffed in there that you can barely see the ground. Better stay on the junk or skip completely - we have seen a lot of caves here and all were more interesting (Tam Coc, Cuc Phuong National Park etc.)
