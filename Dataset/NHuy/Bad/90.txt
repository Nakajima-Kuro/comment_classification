DO NOT GO!!!
We booked tickets to go to Vinpearl as the reviews we read were all very good! When we got there we first went to the ‘Zoo’ and after seeing what living conditions the animals were in we turned back and left.

It was horrible!!

The space where the animals have to roam is extremely small. There is nowhere for the animals to move, they are all very thin and obviously malnourished! All animals looked very depressed as they paced up and down in the tiny space they had to live.

Do not waste your time and give your money to a horrific place like this!
