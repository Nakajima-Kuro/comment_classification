Nice place but is too packed with China Tourist!!
Get your tickets at the counter in VinPearl Land instead of buying online from other 3rd party websites.
Recommended to take the speedboat in and take the cable car out.
You are not allow to bring your own water, they will check your bag.
Make sure you block the area that you queue, otherwise, some China Tourist will just cut your queues. Very bad, no proper queuing system.
Be prepared to queue under the hot sun for at least 1-2 hours for those normal rides and min 3 hours for Alpine Coaster rite.
The wet park closes at 6pm.
