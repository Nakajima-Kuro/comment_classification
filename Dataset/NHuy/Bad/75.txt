Not for us
We heard many people talked about this Vinpearl Land NhaTrang amusement park, so we decided to check it out. Ticket was around 40 USD or 880,000 VND which was not that bad. We got our tickets at the hotel hoping to avoid a long line to buy tickets when getting there. However, it was a huge disappointment when we were here. There was no where that we could find any signs to show us which lines to get on to either buying tickets or getting on the cable cars. The worst thing is that it was so crowded with a lot of Chinese tourists who didn’t speak English, so it did not help for us to ask questions. We couldn’t be able to even find any staffs to ask for directions. Sadly, I and my 4 family members just left without even trying to go to the island as we already imagined how bad it would be, to get in line and to fight with other people who have no sense of what getting in line meant. Sorry to say so but it was so true.
I definitely don’t recommend this place.
