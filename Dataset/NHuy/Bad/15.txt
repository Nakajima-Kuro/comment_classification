Being ruined by tourism
Once upon a time I imagine this was a stunning location. Unfortunately there is now no limit on the number of tourists visiting which means it feels very unsafe (absolutely packed and hard to move with no exits) and is being ruined. To cope with visitor demand they have built a big concrete jetty and poured concrete all throughout the caves as a footpath and then rigged up with electricity. There are more impressive caves elsewhere in the world and that are being much better looked after. UNESCO should ban this type of activity.
