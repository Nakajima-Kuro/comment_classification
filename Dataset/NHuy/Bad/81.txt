Mean-spirited policy
There is a variety of attractions to make a good day out for people of all ages. We particularly enjoyed the gardens and the ferris wheel ride. There was a long queue for the cable car in the morning so we caught the boat which was fast and fun; in the afternoon we were able to take the cable car back and enjoy the splendid views of the water and town. One unpleasant experience was the compulsory search of our bags for food and drink, which are forbidden in order to maximize the profits of the restaurants on the island. We witnessed bags of food and bottles of water being brusquely confiscated from families who came prepared with snacks. This process was intrusive and without a legitimate purpose. Unsurprisingly, the food on the island is overpriced and the meals we had were of poor quality.
