Big disappointment, AVOID this park
Vinpearl Land has turned into a time & money wasting spot. Except the dolphin show, there’s nothing interesting about the park. Looking at the ticket price, the value in return is minimal. The park is not maintained well & we found most of the water rides very dirty. People spitting in the water and no one to monitor. It was quite disgusting!
Along with the tickets, we were given the day’s schedule of the park. We went on Christmas eve and there was a Santa parade supposed to happen near the Ferris wheel. We stayed there for more than 30 minutes waiting for the parade but seems it was cancelled or wrongly put in the schedule. Worst thing is there’s no one available in the information desk or any staff visible around to answer your questions.
The support staff at the bouncy beach was quite RUDE.
The biggest disappointment was the locker and shower area in water park. Around 5PM we came back to get shower, but the locker staff said they ran out of towels (Seriously!!? The park wasn’t crowded so wondering what would happen on a busy day) I felt it’s just a way for the staff to force people buy new towels from their souvenir shops. Well, shocking part is there’s no hot water and soap in the shower area.

Back in 2012, this park was the best attraction in Nha Trang with good service and even utilities like hair dryer too in shower area.
Now I can say – AVOID this place.
