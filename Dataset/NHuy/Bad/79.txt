Zoo is horrendous.
The park itself is amazing, fun rides, great food, great atmosphere, we really enjoyed ourselves until we got to the zoo. Animals are in tiny cages, a poor tiger was walking back and forth clearly showing signs of distress. Hippo enclosure has 2 hippos in a tiny place squished together in the water! I dont think there was one enclosure which seemed acceptable, clearly dont care about the animals. The theme park and water park are so good and fun on there own that vinpearl don’t need the zoo to attract more tourists and get more money! Disgraceful, had to leave as soon as possible as don’t want to support a zoo like that.
