Cruel zoo
The reason I’m giving this a terrible instead of average is the state of the zoo. I’m disgusted by the small cages that consisted of a little umbrella for shade and not much else. Certainly no where for them to get a little privacy from the public who were extremely disrespectful, tapping on windows and yelling at them. It was just a joke that the owners obviously have a lot of land but throw these animals in tiny cages where they have no way to exercise or entertain themselves. The white lion in particular looked extremely malnourished, I actually thought he was dead at first (I've attached a pic to show how skinny he is). Other tiny cages had thrown in several species together and despite the information sheet stating that one type of deer lived near the river there was no water for them to bathe in. We had only come here for the water park but I’m disgusted I paid into somewhere that treats their animals with such little consideration of their needs when the owners of the park obviously have the means to give them a better life.
Additionally, they only have two rollercoasters which are ok and we did enjoy the water park which was good. But we couldn’t use the beach/swim in the sea there because of jellyfish and the lifeguards were very strict about not going in the water.
