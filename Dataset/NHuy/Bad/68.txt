The staff is very rude
Today I went to Vinpearl with my families. When we took the cable car back to the central, the staff assigned my bro to another cable car. I told him we were together but he replied me stupid. So in the end my bro forced to take a separate cable car. But my cable car still left one seat.
I won’t visit this place AGAIN!
