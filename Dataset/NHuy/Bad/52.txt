Too crowded, no historical information
Most importantly, this place was a zoo. If you're interested in seeing Champa-era designs, you should visit the My Son temples near Hoi An. These towers were crawling with tourists more interested in selfies than learning anything about the history of this site. There is no information posted, in English or any other language. You'd be best to visit early in the mornings or just before closing to avoid the tourist buses and read up on the significance before you go as you won't learn anything there.
