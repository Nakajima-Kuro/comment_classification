Don’t go unless you are an adult with a group of 4 people.
My family and I came here on February 17th because we have heard so much about the vinpearl amusement park in Nha Trang. So here we thought maybe it would be the same, hence the name VINPEARL!! but boy oh boy I was wrong, it was a great disappointment. Half of the rides aren’t even as powerful nor nearly as fun as the foreign amusement park. I had fair share great rides such as those of Carowinds in North Carolina, Wonderland of Canada and Universal studio of Florida. As stated by some of comments before, there are NO proper lines to wait..people just randomly skipped us and fitted themselves infront of us wherever they like. Okay fine! I’ll let that line skipping part slide because the wait was not that long. We then decided to head to the water park after we went through most of the ride because like half of the rides are under maintaince. At the water park, my poor 12 years old cousin was not allowed to be in like 90% of the water rides because they deem him too tall for the kiddie slides yet too little for the adult water rides. We were approached by workers telling us that we can’t ride this water slide nor that water slide. Especially the water slide that looks like the funnel with a 4-people floater. You need exactly 4 people to ride the funnel looking water slide, but we only have 3 people. Yet in America, in Canada, in Korea and in vinpearl NHA TRANG even if there are 2 people we can still ride the funnel water slide. You pay so much to go into the park just so people telling you CAN NOT ride anything, and just to go sight seeing. You’ll be disappointed!!
