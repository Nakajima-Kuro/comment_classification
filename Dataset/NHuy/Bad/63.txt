Vinpearl land
All watter atractions are available for people more than 1.3 meters. No one told us. We bought tickets for 3.5mio, however yonger son has only 1.2 meters. Thus we were not allowed to go for all watter attractions. Restaurants not good. Staff spoke to us in russian language. Big queues everywhere. Not possible to take own watter to the island. The main goal is to make us to spent lots of money here. Better to stay in Nha Trang at the beach.
