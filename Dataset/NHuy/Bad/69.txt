Don’t Go!!!
We were a group of four friends keen to go zip lining so we paid all the money happily and waited the booth. Then we were told we had to pick a card to see what time we could go Zip lining. Three of us selected 12 noon and the four person got a better luck next time card. There was no queue for this ride photo attached and the staff didn’t care at all we were told to come back in a hour to try again!!! VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. There were no signs advising you had to try your luck to see when you got a ride. We wasted our money going to Vinpearl Land Would not recommend.
