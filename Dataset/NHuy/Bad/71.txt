Save yourself money and time.
The trip to Vinpearl Land in Nha Trang was a very negative experience and one that I wish I never had! The cable car ride over and back was pleasant enough and the view of the bay was beautiful. However, upon arriving, unless you are taking children to some kind of third rate "Disney" experience, save yourself some time and stay on the mainland or go to other islands. You are essentially a prisoner in the Vinpearl resort, along with thousands of other people. There is a beach with a very small restricted swimming area, so full of people it is worse than swimming in a small public pool. You cannot go outside of this demarcated swimming area, notwithstanding the island is huge, unless you want to pay for water sports, also within Vinpearl Land and right next door to the swimming area. The point is that you are NOT ALLOWED OUTSIDE OF THE PARK. There are hotels,where one might like to have a nice lunch, other beautiful beaches, paths to walk etc etc., but SORRY, you cannot leave Vinpearl Land JAIL. Horrible day!
