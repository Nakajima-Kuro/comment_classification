Nothing much!
Sorry i have to say this site is nothing to compare to Angkor Wat. It's a very small site with a few tiny "temples". We read there would be tourist guide available on some websites but apparently there was none on the day of our visit. So we only got a very brief introduction leaflet from the counter. No further explanations could be found for each little "temple" or whatsoever. A small info center to show some photos of before and after the discovery and renovation. To be honest, some bricks of the structures look a bit too modern (or should i say fake) to build on top of the old ones. If there's nothing much you want to visit in N.T, this place is good to spend your time for about an hour max.
