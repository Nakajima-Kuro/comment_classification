SHUT THIS PLACE DOWN
The worst treatment of animals I have ever seen. How can anybody write a good review for this place!? Not knowing what we were about to walk into we could not believe the extent of the types of animals they were keeping (Lions, Tigers, Rhinos, Hippos, Hyenas) and also in such horrific, tiny enclosures. This was the first and only part of the park we went to, feeling horrendous that we had even given these people our money. DONT GO HERE!
