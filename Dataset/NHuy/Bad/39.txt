Interesting architecture, worth a visit if you have time
Transportation: the walk from the Nha Trang Night Market area to the towers takes about 1 hour and is a good way to see the whole beach area, however, the area before arriving at the towers is stinky and smells of sewage.

The attraction: the admission fee is cheap but the area is small with not too much to see, expect to see many group tours but quieter just before closing time, there were some dance and music performances before closing, walking around the garden and buildings doesn't take very long as the area is small, no dress code was needed unless you wanted to enter the buildings
