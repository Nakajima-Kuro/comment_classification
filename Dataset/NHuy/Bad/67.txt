DON’T GO DON’T GO Terrible and frustrating experience at Vinpearl Nha Trang
Me and my girlfriend was looking forward to going to Vinpearl in Nha Trang in September to spend quality time with each other travelling and exploring. However, we was disappointed by the experience with misleading advertising and marketing. We was both looking forward to going on the zip line together as it was one of the main attractions there. But was only informed once we was inside that there was a lottery and draw to get the opportunity to go on the zip line so we was not guaranteed to go on the zip line. To add to my frustration and anger, we had to wait in line for 20 mins to get the tickets for the zip line by the time we got to the front of the line there were no more tickets. This was all around 4-5pm.
