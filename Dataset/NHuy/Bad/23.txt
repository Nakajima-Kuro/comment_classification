Not worth going there
We hired a motorbike and the waterfall was one of our stops. .. but it was not really worth going there. I've have seen so many, much better, nicer and more impressive waterfalls. The way to go there is bad. From Nha Trang you can take the so called "highway", which actually is must of the time an unsealed road (due to construction). If you really wanna go, take the coast road, which is nicer, a bit longer but much less traffic.
