BAD EXPERIENCE WITH THE STAFF IN VINPEARL
For those who are going Vinpearl, the Alpine coaster was fun and some rides were mediocre. Just to be aware if you have to be careful with your own personal belongings as my friend gold bracelet was almost snatched by the lifeguard. It was the tornado water ride. The lifeguard was supposed to bring my friend out of the water but instead, he pushed her down and try to snatch her gold bracelet. We didn't fight with them because we knew they will be helping their own people. BE EXTRA CAREFUL WHEN YOU ARE THERE, the people they treat you very rudely as well
