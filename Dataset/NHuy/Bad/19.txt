Used to be much better
This used to be a lovely place, approx 1 hour away from Nha Trang city in the mountains, untouched natural beauty. Now however it has changed for the worse and has become a horrible tourist attraction. They have started building in the area and in my opinion this has taken away a lot of the natural beauty it used to have. Still worth a visit but not the same as a few years back.
