A visit from hell
This is supposed to be an idyllic island . Take your swimwear they said . Well this island is horrendous. The water is dirty , fumes from the horrendous old boats overcrowding the moorings are disgusting . And hundreds and hundreds of people just standing looking aghast at the horror of it all . Nowhere to sit unless you paid . Halong Bay is over rated, overfull and over commercialised . It is quite frankly (if you add to it our awful old boat the v spirit classic )the worst place we have visited in Vietnam and Cambodia .
