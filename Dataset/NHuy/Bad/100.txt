The animal is beeing treated horrible
Went here because of the rewievs. At first we had bad luck with the weather and almost ever rollercoaster and others close during rain. We stod in line 1,5 h for the big rollercoaster and despite rules of no smoking in line adults did it anyway. They even skiped the line several times, despite the staff saw this they did nothing. Quite annoying. We moved on to the garden and it was beautiful. After we went to see the birds. They did not have any space, so low cealing and many birds in small area. We felt bad and went outside to the aninals. This was even worse. Skinny lion, many animals in small areas. So so sad to see how bad the animals beeing treated. True human cruelty and abuse.
