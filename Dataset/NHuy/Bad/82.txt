Awful
Went to Vinpearl for a fun day out. Unfortunately this place is completely not as expected. The botanical gardens are lovely and the Toboggan “alpine” ride was really fun. However, the zoo and aquarium was absolutely awful! I was shocked to see the small enclosures and depressed looking animals. I have attached pictures below to show you the full enclosures captured in one photograph. It took me no more than 10 minutes to walk around and take the images which I only stomached so that I could expose this place. I’m so disappointed, the white lion was alone, malnourished and miserable. There was animals crammed into the same enclosure too. Vinpearl has so much to offer but there is no need for a small zoo that takes little interest in the welfare of the animals that are caged there. Not to mention the food was awful at “yummy food” in the water park area. Cold chips, flat cola and no vegetarian options! Aquarium was too small too and the poor reptiles were cramped into tiny small enclosures!! Again, pictures are attached below- I could not believe that two bearded dragons were in the same small vivarium. As an animal behaviour student and an owner of reptiles/amphibians I was disgusted at their lack of space. Many bird species were also given little flying room in a merged walk though area compared to their natural habitat size.
