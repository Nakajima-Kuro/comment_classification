OVERHYPED - Do not trust the good reviews
I don’t know where to start to be honest. Very understaffed as rides take forever to finish and start again. Half of the rides were closed. The water park is very dangerous as the slides are the most ratchet things I’ve ever witnessed. One kid cut his lip and other people fell off several times. Other slides had not enough water and a 7 year old got stuck half way through. This all happened in 5 minutes of us sitting on a bench and observing. The animals are underfed and look miserable. Half of the park is under construction. And it was expensive. Wouldn’t do it again.
