Not worth a visit
Being one of the most talked about attractions in Nha Trang, it sounded like a must visit for my sister and I. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find this place interesting at all when we were there. It’s nothing compared to Angkot Wat in Cambodia. We only spent 20 minutes here before we decided to leave and enjoy buying a cup of sugarcane at the stall outside.
