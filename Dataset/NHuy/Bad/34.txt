The only Champa style temple left in Nha Trang city
This place became extremely busy and dirty due to many tourists, both local and foreign. From outside, you can only see hundred of big buses queuing to unload passengers. Inside, sadly it was very loud and dirty as it seems that the management could do nothing to prevent the place from those annoying things. This used to be a beautiful place but no more now. I rather watch it from far distance.
