Meh.
Visited a lot of temples and religious sites in Asia and was excited to visit here as from pictures it looked a little different. Very disappointed. The facade of the temple looked as though it’s no older that 10 years old and has been rebuilt to please tourists. As it’s one of the few attractions in Nha Trang which isn’t the beach I was expecting it to be busy but the amount of Chinese tourists was incredible. Literally 9 busses waiting in a queue outside full of people to ferry in one after another. This did, however, make for a great people watching place and if you’ve got a bit of free time on your hands then it’s cheap enough to warrant a visit.
