Queues of people. Poor service. Everything costs +200% to regular prices.
Very poor service, sometimes don’t even have a logic in it.
Starting from cable car - waiting for about 30-40 mins in both ways = about 1 hour totally ! 8 people for one cable car and it’s ok if they are slim.
Going to electric mountain car in this queue of people have to wait around 2-3 hours (of your life under the sun) for 5-7 mins of ride. And if you don’t want to wait you can pay extra 150k which is affecting on the main queue, that means if people’s decide to pay it will increase the time of the usual queue of people. In my opinion it’s just a time killer in this island.
Small variety of attractions, I would say it’s for kids or under 15 years old.
Poor service on the water attractions, only ONE lifeguard working for 3 slides like a robot and it’s really affecting on the queue (it’s really slow)... and lifeguards really aggressive sometimes.
Different colors of the slides it’s hard sometimes to find a way or any instructions where to take these buns, I saw many confused tourists...
all the slides working and closing in different time (why they not mentioned it on the map).
It’s hot outside no places to seat or hide from the sun, if you want to drink some water: pay. You have to pay for everything on this island and prices higher +100% or 200% from regular prices for example for a small bottle of water 15k and in regular store (not in this island) you can buy a big one for 10k. I’m a tourist here, but why they cheat me that badly. Water should be free, it’s not a joke.
Finally I spent about 8 hours in this place and I can say its not worth it, service is not even close to other parks in other countries (like in North America). Really poor service... everything doesn’t look new. They don’t even have a background music everywhere to create some thematic-happy mood.. you just walking from point “A” to point “B” to wait in different queue and pay double price for everything.
