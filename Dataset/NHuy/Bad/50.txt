Avoid At Busy Times
I think the experience of visiting this wonderful temple would have been enhanced had there not been so many people there. The number of buses out the front was over the top, as was the crowd inside. I have visited many such temples around the world. There was a total absence of the calm and spirituality that you can glean from such places. Not sure how you could time a visit to avoid the crowds. But if they are there (check the bus count) go elsewhere and give it a big miss!!
