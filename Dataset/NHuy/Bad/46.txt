Somewhere to go on a rainy day
Decided to head here mainly to kill time whist it was raining. Cost about 30,000 vnd in a taxi from the centre and 22,000 for entry to the site.

It was very busy with lots of tourists taking their selfies and posing for photos. I enjoyed taking photos with my new camera but aside from that was a little bored.

The view from the top of the hill isn't very intersting, an industrial river and traffic slowing moving over a bridge. (nothing to write home about)

Not really sure about the culture / history that didn't really appeal after visiting a number of temples in and around Thailand and Vietnam.
