No surprise in the Surprise Cave: too many tourists.
Nothing special about this cave really. It is a big cave with a number of chambers, but it does not give a real cave experience. This may be to do with the fact that you have to walk in line with all the other visitors. It is better to stay in your boat and observe it from a distance.
