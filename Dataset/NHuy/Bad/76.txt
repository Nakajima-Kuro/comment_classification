Extremely Disappointed
I am extremely frustrated at the way my friend and I were treated from the moment we stepped foot at the Vinpearl land. There are no sign posts anywhere when you first arrive to get your tickets which causes confusion and frustration for everyone. As we booked our tickets online to avoid queues (which I would not recommend because it seems like the staff have never seen this before), we asked a security guard where to go and he still told us to go to the ticket office. When we got there the man said no it’s fine we have our online tickets and to go ahead and queue for the cable car.
When we arrived at the cable car queue there was hundreds of people pushing and shoving in a possibly 2 hour long queue.
We left the queue and headed towards the speed boat. When we got to the top of the queue we were told no and to go back to the ticket office because our online ticket was not enough. We were sent back and forth until someone finally said that the tickets were ok. This happened again when we arrived at Vinpearl land. Our experience was completely spoiled by now your staff treated us.
While in Vinpearl land people stared, pointed and took photos of us without our consent. The tourists at the park were extremely rude, even recording us when we were trying to have fun in the water park.
I did not support the zoo, aquarium and dolphin shows and I am horrified in this day and age this park would keep animals captive in horrible conditions. I have read the replies to other review stating that they are cared for etc but how when they are stressed, made to live in tiny enclosures and forced to do shows everyday for the entertainment of humans? This is extremely disappointed and unnecessary.
I will not be recommending this park as we walked away feeling disappointed, embarrassed and harassed from the people in the park.
