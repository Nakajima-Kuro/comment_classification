Don’t go for the animals
Came here during a recent trip to see what all the fuss was about. The toboggan was fun however we had a slow coach in front of us who just stopped their cart every few seconds to take selfies, which kind of ruined the experience for us who were behind and could not pick up any real speed. Very annoying!

The main issue we have with this place is the animals do not look in good condition. The bears were pacing up and down which is a sign of distress. The lions were tiny and looked like they needed food. The emus has plucked all their feathers out. The spaces that the animals had to live in were not adequate and at times we couldn’t even see any source of water for them to drink!

Come here for the rides if you want, but give the zoo a miss - we wished we hadn’t been.
