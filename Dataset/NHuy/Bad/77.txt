Waste of money
Second Vinpearl land iv visited since being in Vietnam.. And I should have learned the first time... When researching it seemed there was an option between the cable car or boat to get there... Only to be told that the boats weren't running.. Lerfect for someone that hates heights but had promised to take my kids there. Even linning up to get into the cable cars we were pushed around by Chinese.. Even grown adults pushing my 5 and 7 year olds out of the way. We end up being separated in the cars there. The line ups for the rides were ridiculous and once again grown adults pushing and shoving like there lives depended on it. Rides targeted to either toddlers or adults.. My kids sit at 120cm and 115cms and couldn't really go on much... 3 rides... They were even denied jumping on the trampolines as that required them to be 130cms?? Don't know why it's safer to jump on a trampoline if your taller... Alpine ride looked great.... Although we went waiting the 2hrs it had up on the gate... Overall another waste of time and money. Super disappointed
