The worst and too far!
We went there with 3 friends an it took us about 40 minutes driving our motorbikes! Then you have to drive in a rocky road for another 2-3km to reach the entry of the park! The fee is cheap (15.000) but it doesn't worth it at all. It is full of garbage and the water stink! The water is brown colored and you have to walk around 15 minutes more in the "park" to get to the "waterfalls".
I've seen better waterfalls in swimming pools.
