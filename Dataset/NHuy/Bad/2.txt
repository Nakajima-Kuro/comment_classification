Beatiful, but too much people!!
That was included in our Halong Bay Tour, a kind of thing my husband and I hate above all: organized tour. ( but it was the only way to spend a night in the bay for us, so we did it)

The cave is such big and beautiful; it would have been a surprise, entering into it for the first time, I can imagine! But the bad thing is that there is one way to enter, one to exit and in between, you have to follow the big crowd conscientiously ( there are boards to follow), laugh at the guide's jokes,...and I definitively did not see any rabbit or happy buddha or swimming lovers!

So for my opinion, don't get there unless you have to.
