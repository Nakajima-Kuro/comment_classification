Waste of time
This historic relic is supposed to be the landmark of Nha Trang. However, I was quite disappointed to visit there. I was sweating like hell under the scorching heat. It was totally crowded with tourists and the scenery was not that impressive. I do not think it is worth spending time to visit this place.
