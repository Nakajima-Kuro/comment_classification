Disappointed with full of Chinese tourists
Got to Nha Trang yesterday after lovlely time in Hoi An and very disappointed with the first place I went to, Ponagar tower well the tower is nice but I could not enjoy much as hundreds of Chinese tourists with their selfie sticks really disturbs me. Won't be back for sure
