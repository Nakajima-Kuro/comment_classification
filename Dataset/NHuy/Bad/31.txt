Can save the route to this site
Only hv few ‘blocks’ left. And the whole site is very small and filed with tourist!
Nothing to compare with the one close to Hoi An— Myson Santuary. Thou only cost Less thn US$1, only go if you really really hv nothing else to do or don’t want any more massage ???????????????!!!.
