Not my cup of tea.
Our teenage grandson was desperate to go. The cable car over was a novelty but didn’t make up for the disappointment when we got there. The food was below average and a third of the menu was not available. The rides were somewhat timid with nothing to really challenge you. I think the place would be ok for smaller children but there is a 1.3 metre height restriction on many rides. Not a fan of seeing large animals being kept in relatively small compounds. Like a lot of places in Vietnam not particularly friendly to people with mobility problems or mobility aids. The Sky Wheel was probably the highlight of the day.
