“Nhà hàng Wind and Sea - Vinpearl Land Nha Trang
Worst experience ever!!! The park was fine but the restaurant service ruined the whole trip. Lunch via tour booking at 1.00pm June 8, 2019; my 14-months twins were tired so we came ealier at 12.30pm. Staff wouldn’t let us in and told us to go outside rudely as they said we would mess up while they were cleaning the tables??? (our advance booked tables anyway); After they let us sit at the corner we ordered a bowl of rice for our hungry babies but they refused saying the kitchen was still cooking WHILE WE OBSERVED they brought large bowl of rice to other tables. Can’t imagine how they treated little babies. The staff were very hostile even towards babies and it looked like they wanted to throw us away, not welcoming at all. I am disappointed as it happened at Vin land. I used to trust Vin service. Terible restaurant service, we won’t be back again. We strongly dont recommend for anyone with babies!!!
