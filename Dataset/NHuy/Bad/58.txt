A pile of tiles
After seeing Borobudur, Prambanan and Angkor temples, this was not exactly exciting. But if you got to see a temple in Nha Trang, it is worth making it. There are a few temples to peek into or even go in, if you have the right attire. Most of the temple complex is renovated and looks just too new.
