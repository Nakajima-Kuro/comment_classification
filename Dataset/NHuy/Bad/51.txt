Hoards of tour buses and over crowded
As a temple i thought it would be a peaceful experience. However when we arrived at approx 3pm in the afternoon there were about 4 bus loads of tour groups at the temple.

There is one part where you can go inside one of the building but it was over crowded. There were too many people in there and it was not worth going in because you could not appreciate it. There is an admission charge - a very small amount - around $30000 VND. It'll take you about 15 minutes to see everything.
