Don't waste your money or your time
Vinpearl Land, nothing special here, and nothing for small children, under 1.1M. Although they charge nearly It will cost you $80 for 2 adults $30 if the child is 1 meter tall and free if under 1m. However to ride the vast majority of rides children must be 1.1 -1.3 meters tall.

I truly don't see how so many rate this place as good or excellent. What a let down.

Stay away is my best advice.
