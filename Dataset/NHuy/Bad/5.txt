Horrible experience and a tragedy of what probably used to be an amazing place
Sung Sot cave is a mainstay stop of most Halong Bay cruises, it is packed full of hundreds and hundreds of tourists, all of whom dont know/werent told not to touch the forming stalatites and miles because they can ruin decades of progess. Though there is very little "natural" left in the cave anyhow - they have turned it into a Disney-like attraction and I felt horrified to be a part of it, left as soon as I could. I can tell that before this became a tourist stop it was an amazing and incredible place, such a shame.
