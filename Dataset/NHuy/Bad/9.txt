Overcrowded and overhyped
Way to many people to be enjoyable. This is a HUGE tourist trap. It is a half decent cave by international standards, but the development of tourist infrastructure, including right inside the cave, makes this a definite thumbs down. There were DOZENS of other tour groups crowding this small cave at the same time. Not very enjoyable at all.
