Good day out but animal welfare is questionable!
Me and my boyfriend visited Vinpearl on our travels round Vietnam. It was a good day out, the water park is great and the 4d cinema was cool. The rides are average, nothing amazing as they are mostly for kids. But the cable car and views are amazing. However Like every other place in Vietnam, the animal welfare standards are very poor and frankly spoilt my time there! The enclosures are tiny, species are mixed and there’s no shelter or place for them to avoid the crowds of people!! The aquarium was good apart from the turtle enclosure which was absolutely tiny and had tortoise and turtle in!!! The owners must be really stupid to not realise that these are to very different animals, you do not put a tortoise in a water enclose with only a few rock to climb on! Such a bad quality of life for them. There was about 30 turtle and tortoise crammed into a tiny space and you could tell how distressed they were? overall it’s a cool place and a lot of money has been spent and made! such a shame not on the important things like the animals !!!!!
