Another beautiful natural treasure soon to be trampled by tourist trap mismanagement into ignominious ruin
It was ridiculously bad weather to visit an overcrowded cave . Like all money generating attractions suddenly developed countries which have stumbled onto a wonder to have enough wow factor to woo locals and tourists alike , Sung Sot cave is so badly managed that it is , like Halong Bay , an accident waiting to happen .
Do not go if you are concerned about slippery steep steps and pushy crowds who will not hesitate to elbow you to get to their group .
Negotiating 200 steps up a narrow winding slope in the pelting rain and 300 steps down with impatient uncouth groups dripping their umbrellas on your already wet shoulders is treacherous .
The cave may be a true wonder with its many chambers but amplified echoes can make it a nightmare 
Another of nature's treasures headed down the deleterious path .
