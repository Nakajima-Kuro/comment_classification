Horrible
Did not realise this waterfall was so hard to get to. By the time we got to the top we were exhausted. There was a stream. We had visions of swimming in the cool clear water which would have made the trek there worth while. The water didnt look clean the surroundings were dirty. Dont recommended for older people. Its just too tough.
