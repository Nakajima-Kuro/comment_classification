not good
the reviews on tripadvisors are pretty good thats why i went there but it was a mistake i paid 900 000dong for the taxi wich is almost 50$ then 30 000 for 2 just to see a waterfall its a long and dangerous walk a local helped me to find my way and obviously she wanted tips but i had only 500 000 note i gave her 4000 she didnt look really happy anyway not worth the money and its very dirty too
