Useless Voucher and limited food options
The overall experience at Vinpearl Land is ok, but the voucher that you are given is useless and they do not allow you to bring water or snacks. You can only use the voucher at certain shops and it’s when you spend 200,000 dong or more on certain items. I tried using it multiple times and couldn’t. They were always out of popcorn and chips and this couldn’t be used for cotton candy. I ended up letting my kids play with them and threw four of them away as I couldn’t use them. (I was at the counter with other patrons who were equally frustrated with the voucher)

The overall food options were extremely limited and only junk food. As I mentioned in the aforementioned paragraph, they were out of most items at the Happy Snack, Yummy Land, and other supposedly quick service shops form when we arrived at 10:40am until when we left just after 6pm. The Lotteria restaurant was where we ate, but we couldn’t use the voucher and it was fried chicken or a hamburger. Given the abundance of fruit across the water in Nha Trang, there were no fruit or vegetable options available.

Sadly, the dolphin show was cancelled due to renovations and the line for the Alpine coaster averaged 2 1/2 hours.

Could have been an amazing experience but hungry kids with limited food options = not a great time!

BTW - bring lots of cash as credit cards are rarely accepted.
