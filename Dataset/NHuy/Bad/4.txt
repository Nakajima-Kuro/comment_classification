I don't like organized tours.
Part of the Halong Bay tour we booked. The cave itself is beautiful but we were not warned that to get to the cave one must climb hundreds of steps. Definitely NOT for people who have cardiac problems. It's damp inside the cave and it's not a short walk to get to the other side. The steps are a bit slippery so wear shoes with good traction. Wear very light clothes as well. I was wearing a singlet but still sweated profusely and was drenched when I got back to the boat. I would have appreciated the cave better if we were given proper briefing about what to expect. We were with about a hundred people inside the cave all following a trail so one cannot really stop and enjoy the sights. There's just too many people and that ruined the experience. Only thing I liked about the place is the view upon exiting the cave. Getting down from the cave is not an easy feat as well. You won't really miss much if you skip this activity.
