A great place to visit
We visited the Ba Ho waterfall after a long period of really big rains so the section at the end with the big rocks was closed. The best access is by motorbike to the entrance parking. There you pay the 40,000 VND entrance fee and on you go. The area at the start of the hike is under development and the road is left is the new one, above the valley. The locals say that soon there will be electric cars taking people from the parking to the waterfall. The waterfall itself is very picturesque. There is a possibility to take a swim there. A nice place for photos...
