Not just for namesake but actually 'Surprise Cave' at Halong Bay
Visited this largest cave at Halong Bay. A series of 300-350 uneven steps, going up & down, with bays to rest for a while, as we move along this natural wonder of Stalagmites & Stalactites, of various shapes & sizes, is a must do activity while in Halong Bay. Pl carry a water bottle as the walk through can be strenuous. It's also called Surprise cave. Be careful of the sink holes that are developing now inside this cave. The authorities should restrict the number of visitors to preserve this natural beauty.
