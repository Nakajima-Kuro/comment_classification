Beautiful cave but a pity that it is not taken care of..
I visited Sung Sot as part of the itinerary of a Halong Bay cruise.. It is a beautiful sight to behold but the many actions of tourist touching the stalagmite and leaning against them, sitting on the stones, leaning against the walls and leaving their oily fingerprints makes it really sad. I've been to caves in Australia both in NSW and WA and the care exercised there - I respect that as it means a form of conservation. It was fun to make out the many different shapes such as one that 'Romeo n Juliet' and the lucky turtle but I really hope that much education and that guides bringing their clients to halong Bay do not encourage them to touch for eg the lucky turtle for good luck.. I was a bit shocked when the guide in the name of good luck and perhaps lack of eco ethos asked us to touch the 'turtle' for good luck. I refused n I could now understand why some ecotourist based outfit do not include the caves now and that's a good move.
