Epic
This place is lovely... definitely make the effort to climb to the very top as it seems most people are lazy and stay lower down the falls which means it's busy and noisy. The further you climb the more spectacular things get...the climb down is through a jungle path and is just as fun as the climb up! Don't be put off by the resort at the bottom, yeah it's commercial but if you can get over that then the refreshing pools at the top are well worth the scrambling over huge boulders! I'd visit again in a heart beat! One word of caution though, ensure you have a way to get back!! We used the grab app and couldn't get a driver to pick us up...ended up walking the 3 km back to the road then about another 3 km before flagging down a taxi, not the end of the world and was an exciting way to end the day!
