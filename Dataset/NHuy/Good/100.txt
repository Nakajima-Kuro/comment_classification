Beautiful View and Cool Refreshing Pools!
A really awesome place to spend half a day! There are three pools/waterfalls that you can swim in. The first one is pretty easy to get to but it takes some climbing over large boulders to get to the other 2 waterfalls. It's a little tricky, but it was worth it. The water was a perfect temperature in the hot air.
