Worth A Visit
Whilst not the best cave I had visited, it does has a collection of many very good and interesting structures inside. It was really crowded, with a long line due to the bottleneck entrance into the cave. But once inside, the distance quickly got farther between people and it became much more cooler and comfortable. There were two lookouts to view the bay outside the cave, one at the entrance and the other at the exit. Nice to include after hours of sailing and cruising.
