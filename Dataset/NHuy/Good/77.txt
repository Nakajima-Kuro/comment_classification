Awesome place to spend the day
The hiking was amazing and gets more challenging as you continue from lake 1 to lake 3. There is a wonderful restaurant and bar to satisfy the traveler after the hike. Included with the admission is access to the pool and a variety of water activities. Would highly recommend for anyone from individuals to families.
