No problem about claustrophobia
I can’t say that I’m a great fan of caves. I’m not unduly claustrophobic, but I’m a bit unsure about have several thousand tons of apparently unsupported rock over my head! However, this cave is so huge that it doesn’t generate any anxiety. The rock formations are truly breathtaking, and nicely lit. Well worth seeing.
