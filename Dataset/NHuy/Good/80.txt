Good spot for cliffdiving and chilling
Its a realy must visit place when u are in Nha Trang. For 100.000vnd u have an acces to kayak and sup activities and 1km furtther there are 3 stages, basically the first one is the best place for swimming and cliffdiving (heights around 5 and 10m, maybe less), Also there is a medical guy on duty nearby. On the 2nd stage u can find a very nice and even romantic teeterboard above the lake and its not really hard to get there, just to clumb few meters by rocks, they made all arrangments, so now its possible to get there almost for everybody, except u are very old and can barely walk ;)
