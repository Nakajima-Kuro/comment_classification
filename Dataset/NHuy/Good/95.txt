Hidden Gem!
Our hotel order us a taxi to take us to Bo Ha Waterfalls, the driver waited for us well we hiked and swam. Totally cost during Tet, one million VND. Total time 3 hours. Fairly easy hike, with a bit of a boulder climb, they have ropes to help you along. It is beautiful! The water is clean, and a perfect temperature. Great way to get out of the city.
Tip: they sell water there, and they have lots of clean toilets! Cliff diving as well..
