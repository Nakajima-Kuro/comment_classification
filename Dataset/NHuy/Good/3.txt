Nice Bay
By just some clicks on a website, you will easily see any information you need (cruise type, cabin size, amenities, anything). Anytime, anywhere, so convenient, right?

BUT, the reason I told you to seek for a reliable agency is nowadays, there are hundreds of travel agencies want to sell your services. Not all of them can guarantee the quality they promote and advertise. Among hundreds of cruises in Halong Bay, this local can tell you that not 100% of them can serve you satisfied. Depend on many elements such as how long did the cruise run, how good their staffs are, how often the cruise maintains their facilities, etc. the quality of different cruises is different. Don’t choose too cheap prices, as you know, you buy cheap you buy twice, if not be careful, low quality and unsafe cruises (facilities, services, foods, etc.), miscellaneous additional charges will not be explicitly announced. Otherwise, the cheap prices you see might have hidden additional fees or charges, so cheap might become not cheap at all.
