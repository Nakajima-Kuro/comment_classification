Nice place to spend a day
We went there on a rental motorbike from Nha Trang City on the early morning. Stopping by few cities on the way to reach there later at noon. Its a long walk to reach the last waterfall but very interesting and adventurous. Highly advisable to wear a tricking or running shoes also at the end you might fall in the water to reach the last point which exactly what happened to me. Its a good place to swim as well so you may get a swimming wear. Finally try to leave the waterfall area before sunset as its really hard to walk back in the dark
