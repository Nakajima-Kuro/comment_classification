Beautiful countryside
A real gem, this one. If you want to get out of the urban jungle of Nha Trang, 30 minutes to the north is this place. A bargain price for a beautiful, instagramable location. The swimming and cliff jumping is amazing as is the little “nibbler” fish that clean your soles for free. Will definitely come again!
