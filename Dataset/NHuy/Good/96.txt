Loved this wayerfall
Definitely worth a visit, the waterfall is big and there is 3 different parts you can swim in. The water is nice and warm. You can easily spend half a day here or a full day if you take some snacks! You can also buy food here. Quite a hard trek up to the waterfall but so worth it! Really enjoyed our day here.
