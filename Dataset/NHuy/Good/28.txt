Don't Miss This!
If you go on a cruise of Halong Bay in Vietnam and miss this one then you have been with a cowboy operation.
All good cruise companies include the Sung Sot Cave or the Surprise Island, as some call it,
Basically, it is a limestone cavern in one of the myriad limesone karsts of Halong bay and complete with stalagmites and stalactites..
It involves a short bit of steep climbing which I managed in style and at the age of 63. Then you walk down into a cathedral like cave, lit with different coloured lights which gives it a surreal appearance,
The pathways are well maintained and you would be rather stupid to fall off and injure yourself.
Enjoy it with your own eyes rather than trying to take pictures with your mobile device and immediatly posting the pics on Facebook!
There are a few soft-sell and discreet souvenier sellers but that is all the tackiness involved.
