Challenging walk
The waterfall area was managed very well, it was clean and nice for tourists to walk. The roads before reaching the main waterfall area was easy to walk. More challenging climbing and walking starts when you reach the main waterfall area. You must be really careful, follow the arrows marked on the rocks. Remember to wear shoes that are not slippery!
