Stunning - loved it
Our Air BnB host organised us a driver & 7 seater vehicle (we are family of 6) return from Nha Trang for 700,000 Dong, possibly cheaper with taxi but we were happy. We took food but there is a sign saying no outside food/drink to be taken in. You enter into a resort area with a swimming pool & inflatable obstacle course & games on the river. You follow a path to the waterfall, most of which to number 1 is an easy walking path but the last part is over rocks including a little climbing with the help of a rope. The waterfall and pools at the bottom are beautiful, clean and cool. The climb over to waterfall 2 is more challenging and we didn’t go to number 3. We loved this day and highly recommend it, even if you didn’t make it to any of the waterfalls the pool and other activities in the surroundings are beautiful.
