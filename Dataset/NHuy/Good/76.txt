A mini adventure
It was one of the first places we visited in Nha trang. The kid loves waterfalls and springs. We took a cab from city centre and agreed with him to wait for us for 3 hrs.

We left around 10.30 am and got there when the place was just about stirring awake.

Entrance fees involved ...6 yr old bordering on 120 cms got to go in free.

Once we enter its a well paved pathway right upto lake 2.We skipped the boating and paddling lake as it was way too hot but you could try it ..they provide life jackets and stuff. On the way there were some photo opps with painted rocks..swings and a bird's nest.A good warm up.

We hit Lake 3 which is a harmless pool of water with a cute swing. Kid and daddy splashed about. Cool and safe.

Dragged the kid out (with a promise of ice cream) for the hike to lake 2 which is a bit more rocky and slippery. But still good for kids to play about. We stopped by on the way back.

The hike to Lake 1 is a bit tough but has arrows marking out the route. There were some tight spots but nothing 6 to 7 year olds cant manage under close supervision.

The lake there was pristine and extremely slippery..so watch every step. We spent close to an hour just sitting there and letting the fishies nibble our feet...and then back home.

We would have tried the cliff jump if there were attendants..but we were on our own so didnt want to risk it.The toilets are clean...snack bars at every 200mts...overall a good option to spend half a day.
