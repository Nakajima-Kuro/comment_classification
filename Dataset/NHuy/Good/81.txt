Even better than expected
Some friends and I split the cost of a Grab car to the location about 30min from Nha Trang (~ 3 usd each). Be sure to get the driver's number to call for pick up or set a time for him to return because it could be a bit tricky getting cheap transport back. (Supposedly there's a public bus that you can walk 1km to that'll take you back.) Pay 150k vnd (~ 6 usd) for entrance into this resort style park. Take a dip in the pool, use the kayaks, paddle boats, or zorbs included in the price, or snag a meal at the restaurants. To get to the main attraction - the waterfall - walk 15 min into the resort and then follow the path climbing on rocks and using footholds to either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd waterfall pit stop. The trail gets harder as you go, but it is so worth it! I think the 2nd pool is the best. Swim where the little fish nibble at your dead skin then climb into the waterfall for a natural jet massage on your back.
You could spend a whole day here or minimum a half day. Money and time well spent!
