Truly spectacular
We did an Indochina 2d 1n cruise on the dragon pearl. Did a lot of research and it seemed unanimous that you should pay the extra and travel with a reputable company that has access to Bai Tu Long bay instead of the hustle and bustle of Halong Bay to get away from the crowds. Even though expensive it was definitely worth it. The scenery was amazing and so quiet and calm. Probably would have been nicer to do the extra night but we didn’t have time.
