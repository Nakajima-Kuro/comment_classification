amazing cave visit in the middle of Halong open sea
visiting caves is not my preference because i dont really like dark and wet environment. but this cave really been well maintained. the lighting is amazing which provide a lot of nice photo spots. the crowd is huge and be ready for queuing to take your favorite photo.
