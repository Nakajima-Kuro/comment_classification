Lovely cave formation
This is I believe one of the best cave attractions in Halong bay.
You have to climb a set of 100 stairs and than go down 100 stairs to see the beautiful lime formations in the caves.
Very well lit with formation of limestone and structures.
Great opportunity to take so great snaps the view from the top is breathtaking
Highly recommend
