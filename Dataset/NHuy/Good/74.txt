Paradise!!
This place is incredible! We felt that we reach paradise.
367k grab from the city then we ask our grab drive to pick us up and agree on 300k for the way back, the park + water activities cost 100k each .
So we pay 867k in total for the transportation and park fee and i must say it worth much more money!
