Stunning
This place is absolutely stunning, from the minute we arrived there we was blown away with how picturesque it was there, we walked past some lovely looking bungalows from the resort, then came across the river with inflatables, canoes, peddle boats, which was all free of charge to use with the entrance fee into the waterfalls, and a stunning infinity pool, with sun loungers around, a restaurant & little stall selling ice cold drinks, then you walked further up towards the 1st waterfall and there’s a stunning area, with giant birds nests which you can sit in, swings, dream catchers, rocks that you can make designs out off, then you can carry on up towards the waterfalls there’s plenty of little stalls & little bar area you can stop at & get refreshments along the way, you come across a lake area where you can have a little swim & a free fish pedicure, as you step into the water you have all the little fish come and nibble at your feed.
Please be aware it’s best to wear enclosed shoes, they will definitely help to walk up to the waterfalls, flip flops will get you to the first section of the waterfalls but that’s about it (and even that can be abit difficult) unfortunately we couldn’t climb to the 2nd or 3rd section of the waterfall because we didn’t have the correct shoes ??.
Was a absolute stunning day loved this place.
