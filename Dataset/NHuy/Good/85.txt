Nice place for a picnic/detox
Nestled outside of Nha Trang, at a comfortable distance by motorbike, this was a nice way to spend few hours. Most places in Nha Trang are overly touristic and extremely busy; thankfully this was not the case here in this particular day. The entrance ticket (100k p.p.) included boat/kayak/water bike ride (you chose) which was nothing special to be honest. But what I liked about the path to the waterfall (about 1km from entrance) was the numerous resting places created on the way. It’s not overly artificial, you still feel close to nature but at the same time it is very convenient. The prices of drinks and food are very reasonable. The waterfall themselves are nice. We went on extremely hot day and it was perfect. Free massages from the fish in the water as well! :)
