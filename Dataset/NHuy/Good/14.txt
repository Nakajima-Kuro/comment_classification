Looks 10, Feels 3
No fault of the uniquely fascinating views, visiting and cruising Bai Tu Long Bay in late summer, early rainy season is a grueling ordeal if you are unaccustomed to saturation humidity and unvarying smoldering temperatures. The upshot is an oddly cognitive dissonant experience, with your eyes screaming magnificent beauty all around you, but your limp, sweat-soaked body whimpering like it's enduring a non-stop open-air sauna. When I look at the transcendent photos I took now, safely home, I marvel at how miserable I was at the time I gathered my waning strength to click the shutter. My recommendation: go, yes, but in the driest, coolest season.
