Brilliant cave
A great trip to Halong Bay and see the amazing Cave was extremely brilliant where we could have about an hour to discover the cave in the late afternoon. Amazing view from the top of the cave where could see the skyline of Halong Bay and all cruises around. We enjoyed our time here by Aclass Opera Cruise!
