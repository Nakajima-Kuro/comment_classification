Hike and adventure
Good place for a hike and walk. Anyone is welcome to go however better be ready for a small hike to access the waterfalls. Ensure to stay hydrated and bring non-slip shoes if going ahead to the waterfalls. Great view from there and can swim in the lakes. Just beware of the fish. They bite!!!
