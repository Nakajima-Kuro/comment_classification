Amazing HUGE cave to explore.
Be oprepared to climb 5-6 stores of stairs in order to reach the cave entrance. Take your time, because its workth it! A few spots on the climb allow for photogra[hy of Halong Bay beneath. Cave it well lit for the most part, but pay attention to where you are walking as one man missed his step and took a hard fall. Upon exitiing the cave, we rounded a bend on the trail and came across a wild monkey - what a surprise!
