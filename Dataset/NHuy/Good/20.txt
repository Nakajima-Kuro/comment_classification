that was amazing
Enjoyed our trip to Halong Bay, we visited Amazing cave by Aclass cruise , it was extremely nice. The deepest pont of the grotto, a royal garden appeared with a clear pond and a seemingly fascinating landscape of mountains. Many birds and pants like banyan tree, Benjamin figs live here. The guide was helpful and explained all meanings with high knowledge
