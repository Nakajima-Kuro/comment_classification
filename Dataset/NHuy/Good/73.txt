Early Visit made it perfect
What a cool wee gem this place is!!! We left Nha Trang by taxi at around 7am...got there at about 7:45/8am before ANYONE else was there. It is so worth doing this. The earlier you get there, the quieter and more peaceful the place it. We felt like we had our very own private reserve all to ourselves.

If you ask your hotel, they can organise a taxi drive to take you up there, wait for you and then bring you back. It wasn't very expensive.

They have clearly decided to try and capitalise off this area. They have built little eco lodges you can stay in overnight, there are cafes and restaurants and beautiful areas to relax in near the river. Some people may say it's "touristy" because of this, but I think that if it helps the locals make some money, more power to them. We really enjoyed going even though the falls were quite dry given the season. We would like to return to stay in the eco lodges one day!
