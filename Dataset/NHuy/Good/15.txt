Not bad, but not great
Well, judging by he pictures, you are expecting something amazing. Don't get me wrong, it's still very nice, but weather can really influence it. During our visit, weather was good, but it was very gray, so everything looked kinda gray. Unfortunately you can't influence this, and can't really know if this weather will caught you..Good thing is, there were hardly any other boats.

Monkey Island was great, and you have great view from the top!

All in all, not bad, not great either, but worth it!

Went there on I think half a day cruise, was around 300k(around 12-13$), which is not bad, got a meal with it on the boat. Don't think it's worth it to pay more for more expensive cruises, from what I got it by comparing rutes they all do more or less same thing.
