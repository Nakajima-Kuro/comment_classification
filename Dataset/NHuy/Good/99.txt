Nice trip from downtown.
I actually downloaded the trip advisor app just to review this place. Contrary to other reviews, I found ba ho waterfalls to be very clean. I counted over 30 trash cans scattered across the area and saw numerous people removing trash from the higher areas of the falls. The path to the 1st and 2nd pools is easy enough, though as others have mentioned the 3rd pool is a lot more difficult. We ended up going to the 3rd pool but heading back to the 2nd as the water looked better for swimming in there. Spent about 4 hours (including 600,000 vnd return cab journey from the Sheraton) and would totally recommend. Wear comfy sneakers if you plan on going to the 3rd pool!
