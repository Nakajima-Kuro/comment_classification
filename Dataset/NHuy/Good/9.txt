Much better in comparison to most others
I ought to state that this is really one of my unforgettable and enjoyable experience in Vietnam. Baitulong Bay is really beautiful ? Thank god that the early morning I went the temperature was favorable to us without any rainfall. Practically nothing beats having to see this beautiful pure question for your own eyes, especially after the 100 steps climb on the island. It was just gorgeous ?
