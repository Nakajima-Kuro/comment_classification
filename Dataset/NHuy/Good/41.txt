Impressive large cave
The cave is on an island in Halong Bay. It is understandably extremely popular but well organised to deal with the large number of vistors. Avoiding the peak months should mean no queuing. There are over 700 steps along the route up into the cave then down into it. The cave is very large, well paved, and has effective lighting. Plenty of stalactites and stalagmites.
