Awesome time exploring the waterfalls
Beautiful spot with a short walk up to the top waterfall, the start of the walk is quite easy and was wondering why everyone said take walking shoes then when we got into the climbing the rocks part completely understood why running shoes were needed! If your not going to climb the rocks thongs would be okay but if you want to get up and see the waterfalls then wear your runners. Was a fun climb up to the waterfalls, visited all 3 available to explore. Such beautiful fresh water, easy directional signage to work out where your next move will be. Water ways fill with little fish which liked to nibble on your feet if you left them in there long enough, was quite funny really! Although it is becoming touristy, if it wasn't touristy then we wouldn't have found out about it, the toilets along the way along with water stops were great! High recommend if you like to explore a little! You might find our sunnies that we left behind! haha!
