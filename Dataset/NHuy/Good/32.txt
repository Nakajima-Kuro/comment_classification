Sung Sot Cave afternoon
There was a human traffic jam waiting to get inside the cave so it affected the otherwise pleasant experience in the cave. The cave itself is really nice with the unique desert-like ceiling that I have not spotted anywhere. I particularly like the neutral lighting (unlike the normal colorful lighting that kinda distracts you from the intricacies of the rock formation inside the cave). It also leaves room for imagination and appreciation of the simple art of nature. The cave is a bit slippery though so be mindful of your steps. Recommended experience!
