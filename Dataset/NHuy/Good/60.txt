Worth a visit during the cruise
These caves are large and you need good footwear to go through them. It’s quite a climb to start with and then it’s ok with pathways and low rise steps. There is a very short 2 minute stretch that could catch claustrophobics out but it’s soon over. The formations of stalactites and stalagmites are good as natural forms and there are the usual trinkets etc to buy on the way out.
