"Surprise Cave"; Unique & Otherworldly UNESCO Experience
Discovered in 1901 by the French and originally named "Grotte des Surprises", Sung Sot Cave is located on Bo Hon Island in the center of Ha Long Bay. Sung Sot Cave is the most famous of the Ha Long Bay caves. Also known also as Surprise(s) Cave, this is one of the largest caves in Ha Long Bay, containing thousands of stalagmites and stalactites, within its two chambers. Cave dwellers must ascend steep steps along a lush stairway up to the cave's entrance. Views of the grotto cove below are stunning from this vantage. Explorers will enter a smaller chamber, then pass through a narrow pathway into the massive "Opera" chamber. While the illuminated pathway provides an ethereal effect, natural light also filters into the Opera. Surprisingly, my claustrophobic husband did not encounter any problems within this expansive interior. Soaring ceilings with differing textures keep the visitor entertained and impressed. It is a magical exploration of a unique and otherworldly UNESCO designated treasure.
