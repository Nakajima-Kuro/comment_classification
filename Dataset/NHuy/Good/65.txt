Good value activity
We walked to the waterfall and then continued on to the other lakes (i.e. waterfall swim holes). The first is easy to get to, however the other two do require some climbing over rocks. Nice refreshing water. The other activities include paddleboards, kayaks etc and a swimming pool.
