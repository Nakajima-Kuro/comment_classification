A must place to visit in Ha long Bay
Everyone visiting Halong bay must visit Sung Sot Caves. This is a very large and wonderful cave. It is not recommended for people who are claustrophobic and people who have issues climbing up stairs. Proper sport shoes are recommended for visiting the caves as it involves a lot of climbing up and down steps. From the inside it is breathtakingly beautiful.Totally worth to visit.
