The reason to come to Nha Trang!
I went with no expectations, and was well and truly amazed by Ba Ho. It costs 100vnd each for entry which includes your entry to the waterfall, use of the pools and facilities and also water sports. Absolute bargain for what you get.

Make sure to take comfortable and sturdy shoes, as the climb to the falls is pretty intense! You will be climbing up rocks using ropes and metal handles. There are 3 different waterfalls and the climb is more intense as you ascend - we got a right sweat on! Well worth it as the falls are beautiful with clear water, swings, fish and cliff jumping spots.

If you’re comfortable riding a scooter I’d recommend riding there as it’s a nice drive and about 15-20 mins from Nha Trang centre. We worked out that doing this and paying entry on arrival works out much much cheaper than booking through the hotel. I would recommend making a quick stop off at the Ponagar Tower en route.

We went in December and it wasn’t busy at all which was perfect!
