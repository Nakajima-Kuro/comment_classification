Day getaway
We had a great time at the waterfall. We left early in the morning, about a 35min bike ride to get there just after 8am so that it wouldn't be too full and not as hot. The hike was gorgeous!! I only got to the second level, my boyfriend did all 3. Prepare for alot of jumping between rocks and vertical climbing towards to end. It can be quite tricky but well worth it. We had a dip in the pools with fresh waterfall water. The property is beautiful with the restaurants, canoe section and water games area is great for families. The swimming pool was beautiful and the whole area had relaxing music in the background. Can easily spend 4-6 hours there.
