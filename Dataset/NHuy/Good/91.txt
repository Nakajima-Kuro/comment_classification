Great day trip
If you get a chance to go it’s well worth it. We booked through a tour which was way over priced. You can hire your own taxi and go. The admission is only 50,000. I’m sure the cab would be reasonable. You must wear good shoes for rock climbing! We weren’t aware of this and just had sandals. So a bit tricky. A few spots where you need to use a rope to hall you up the rocks. I would say maybe a 40 minute hike to the top.
The pools were nice for swimming. There is a guard 3/4 ways up in case you have trouble. You can pick up water or beer along the beginning of trail. Washrooms there too.
