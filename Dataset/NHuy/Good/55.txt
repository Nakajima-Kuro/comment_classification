Crowded but great expereince
Went here this morning . I was dreading the long stairs that go up the mouth of the cave. There is a warning for people with heart problems not advisable to climb the stairs.

To be fair, the stairs leading to the cave of the mouth is a lot lot safer than the staircase at Titov Island. Titov Island is steeper and not equal steps and big gaps without hand rail. The Sung Sot cave had heaps of resting place and also one way in and out of the cave is on there other side.

The cave is really massive when you get in and although heaps of tourists, the strategically lightings give the cave life and more drama.

So people with physical disabilities and heart or breathing problems... not for you.
