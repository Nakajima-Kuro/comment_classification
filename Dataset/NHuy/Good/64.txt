Wonderful Cave and Easy Walk
It is a nice cave and was surprised by the breathtaking panoramic view of the bay. It is well lighted cave and at times you have to be careful that you do not slip. It is the largest cave in the Ha long Bay area. Stalactites and stalagmites have formed over millions of years and have taken fascinating shapes.
