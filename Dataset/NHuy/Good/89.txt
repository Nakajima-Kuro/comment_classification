Beyond expectations!
We visited on a weekday and took a taxi from Nha Trang beach to the falls - about 40 minute drive. You can negotiate about AUD30 for a return trip where your driver waits a few hours for you. Entry fee is about AUD6.
The site is newly developed with food, toilets and showers with some lovely viewing platforms to relax and take in nature or challenge yourself climbing the waterfall.
If you want to see and swim in the waterfall ponds, wear sturdy shoes and be prepared for some challenging climbs.
Being so close to town, we were surprised how few people were there. Perhaps it’s busier on weekends.
What to take:
- bathers
- walking shoes. Climbing to all three falls is challenging with ropes and handholds. Don’t wear thongs
- insect repellant. Mozzies are huge
- small towel. You’ll want a swim at each stop
We spent about 3 hours hiking and swimming then cooled down with beers and food at the pool afterwards.
Great day out. Definitely going back.
