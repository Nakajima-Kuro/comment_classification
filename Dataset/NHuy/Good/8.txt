Highly highly recommended
Bai To Long Bay / Halong Bay overnight cruise is a must do activity . The limestone karsts in middle of the sea with green cover are very picturesque. The sunrise and sunset creates spellbinding views. Vietnam trip won't be complete without the Bai Tu Long Bay or Halong Bay cruise. We had chosen Bai Tu Long Bay as it was less touristy but I hear from others that both bays are equally good.
