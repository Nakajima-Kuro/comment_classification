Huge Cave
This is part of the tour of our ship in Halong Bay Cruise. The cave is huge and be warned that there are a lot of walking and climbing up stairs.

There are a lot tourist when we went there. But this is one of the caverns I've been that is really big with high ceiling and goes out to top of the mountain and ends up with a beautiful view of Halong Bay.
