Finest and biggest grottoes of Halong Bay.
This place is a part of the Halong Bay tour which we booked last month. As its name. It is unexpected with a large space with thousand of stalactites, sparkling and colorful by the light. It is very humid inside and we must to be carefull when walking inside as some of the pathways are a bit slippery. All in all it is one of the finest and biggest grottoes of Halong Bay.
