My family and I had an amazing time! Adriano our guide and Edson our driver were excellent! They were so nice, kind, patient, even played music for us on the bus during the ride. Adriano is by far the best tour guide i've had so far in Rio! He knows the history of his country and is proud to share it with travelers. He spoke in English, French, Spanish and Portuguese to make sure that everyone on our bus understood. I highly recommend this perfect duo: Adriano and Edson!!
