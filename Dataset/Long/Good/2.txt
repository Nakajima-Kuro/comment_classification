Hard to rate a church as so much depends on what you believe and why you have gone there. I go primarily because of an interest in photography, architecture - and religion (as an observer). The roof in this church is spectacular. The whole scale of it is impressive and it repays a leisurely visit even if the very low levels of light make photography a bit of a challenge. Sad that it is necessary to have armed troops on duty outside a church and to have an x-ray machiine to check your belongings but I suppose that is a sign of the times we live in. Having said that, I doubt if the two civilians on duty at the x-ray machine would have noticed if I had carried in a rocket launcher. They were too engrossed in conversation to notice me!
