We went to the summit of the Eiffel tower. It is 324m in height. It was a memorable day in our life.
We purchased online tickets in advance and booked the time slot 10.30am. We went to the place around 9am and got familiarised with the area. It was a nice palce but careful with the pickpockets and some unknown gamblers. Some pretty girls approached to us with forms and asked us to fill it and demanded 10 Euros since they are collecting money for fund raising but luckily police came and they ran away.

Although we booked our time in advance we have to gone through a thorough security check. We went to the lift and went to the 2nd stage first and changed to a another lift and went to the summit. Since we visited the place on 15th December, it is very cold. You have to have a proper clothing to withstand the temperature and the breeze. The summit view was fantastic. There are binoculars on the summit and you can enjoy. The Eiffel tower is well organized place there are restaurants, souvenir shops, toilets within the tower.
