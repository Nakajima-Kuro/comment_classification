One of the topmost priority on a visit to Paris is no doubt the ' Eiffel Tower' .A daytime tour and view of Paris from the second floor is excellent and a must for one visiting Paris. The time taken in tour depends upon security clearance and rush but is quite systemic.
The view at night with lighting every hour is marvellous and should not be missed.
