We wanted to tell people to stay longer, and visit all the incredibly unique sites! Thatâ€™s what we did! We based out of Ninh Binh and went to all of them. We stayed 5 nights. Depending on the weather we chose the order in which we visited each place. Trang An was first up, we went early, on a Tuesday morning. There were no lines and we had the place almost completely to ourselves. It was a glorious blue-sky-sunny day perfect for taking pictures. We were there for 4 hours. There is a lot to see and some of the stops took time to go up-and-down the steps. I lost count of how many caves we went through but they are definitely the highlight to an already excellent rowboat tour. The place is huge and they have more than one route. We highly recommend this activity!
