Impressive place although the entrance is chaotic. Get your tickets beforehand and e there early because the lines will become endless if you decide to "take it easy". The history there will overwhelm you and it will give you a quick glimpse as to how Roma used to handle itself. It is certainly a must do thing while in Rome.
