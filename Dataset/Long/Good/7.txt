Very beautiful and peaceful. Full of torii gates that will make you company all the way to the top. There are traditional shops (for souvenirs or drinks) and restaurants where you can truly experience the Japonese way, by sitting on a cushioned pad (after removing your shoes). I tried myself and it was great after all that walk and even had a warm tea plus the traditional sweets. I'm just not that flexible to stay closed legged in a sitting position for a long time.
I would advise to have comfortable shoes to make a better experience in each step and warm layered clothes if travelling on cold season. Great Place to visit it and would go again.
