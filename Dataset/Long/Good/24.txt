Lovely day and great river views. What could have gone wrong ? Nothing, it wasn’t even that busy but great to walk over such an iconic bridge. I think if you are English you don’t appreciate LONDON as much as if you visited another European city. It’s got a lot to offer. My advice download the Bus App and stay off the tube, the buses and views are great
