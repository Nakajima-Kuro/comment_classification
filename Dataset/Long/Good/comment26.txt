You can choose between 3 different routes by the boat tour, so its different caves.
The lake is very clean and the caves amazing! We also visited some pagodas and important places for praying for buddism people.
Its really worth the money.
I visited in early morning, so you can hide from the sun, because the boats have no roof!
