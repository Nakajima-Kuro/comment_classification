With most historic landmarks, you have to put your eyes on it for yourself to marvel at the beauty of the iconic structure.

There’s a restaurant at the bottom and middle levels of the tower. Also if there aren’t enough ticket booths open then the lines to go up top move fairly slow. There are a couple options to go from the ground floor to the middle section, you can pay to walk up the stairs or you can take the elevator; depends on the journey you want to take. There’s additional elevators that will take you all the way to the top where you can see the secret room that Mr. Eiffel used to conduct meetings. As well as magnificent views of the city of love, stay for the sunset and you won’t regret it.
