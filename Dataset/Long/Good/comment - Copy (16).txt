This beautiful pagoda is a bit tricky to find on your own. You’ll definitely need a GPS, or guide to help you find this. It is beautiful, and peaceful once you do get there. Make sure you take pants and a sleeved shirt though, as you won’t be able to wear sleeveless tops. The pictures really speak for themselves, and are quite accurate though, and the place is beautiful.
