It took us 20 minutes to clear security, 10 minutes to queue to buy tickets to walk up (you can’t prebook) oh and 15 minutes for the ladies toilet! We walked up to the 2nd floor, the views were amazing and it was fascinating to see the structure close up.

If you’re unfit like me it’s tiring and your legs know you’ve done it but not impossible. We had a break at the first floor and wonder around before continuing to the 2nd floor where we grabbed coffee and a pretzel and a sit down before catching the lift to the top. It really is worth the extra money.

Walking down was far easier! Our teenager enjoyed walking far more that the cramped lifts.

Walking takes time in all with security, queues, walking up & down, as well as enjoying the views we were about 2 and half hours
