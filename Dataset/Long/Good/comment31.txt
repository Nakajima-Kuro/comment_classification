Wow beautiful caves, clean glass water, so relaxing mountain area. Boat riders are friendly and hardworking, don't forget to give them some small tip per trip (50,000 - 100,000 vnd) They would be so happy because they have few trips per week only. It is indeed the World Nature Heritages. Highly recommend to visit Trang An!
