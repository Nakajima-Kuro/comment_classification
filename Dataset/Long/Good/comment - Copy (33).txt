The iconic symbol of Paris, and indeed France, stands tall and grand, surrounded by thousands of like-minded tourists clambering for the best photo, or in many cases, selfie.
We saw it lit up at night, when, at 9pm, a glittering display took place, making it look even better against the clear sky that we had.
We opted not to go up it but we're more than delighted to see it from the river, from underneath it, from the Montparnasse tower, in day, at night.
