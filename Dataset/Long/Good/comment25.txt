Yes the Trang An Grottoes are quite crowded (like everything in Vietnam), but it is still a must-do activity. Maybe we were lucky, but once we got started, we didn't feel like there were that much people. The fact that the place to explore is really big might also be why we didn't feel squeezed.

We took route 3 due to recommandations by people on TripAdvisor and we're glad we did! There were less people on it and the 1 km-long cave was very impressive.
