If we ask someone about the Elizabeth Tower, he or she may get confused. But one will not think twice if we talk about the Big Ben, the iconic tower in London. We had a nice view of the tower with Westminister Abbey in the background from atop the London Eye though it is currently encased in scaffolding for renovation work which started in 2017. Till 2021, when the renovation work is scheduled to be completed, Big Ben's famous chimes will remain silent but its attraction will remain undinished to the tourists and all.
