Knock out the major attractions in one day with this tour. They picked my wife and I up from our hotel in Copacabana in a modern van with a/c. Flavio was our tour guide and he did an excellent job talking about history on the way to each stop. Time was managed well and we had plenty of time to walk around and take photos. Entry fees are all taken care of and the tour also includes lunch (excluding drinks) at an all you can eat Brazilian steakhouse. I definitely recommend C2Rio and this tour if it's your first time in Rio.
