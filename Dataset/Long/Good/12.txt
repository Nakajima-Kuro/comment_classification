The golden pavilion is beautiful to see in person. The reflecting pond is big and the perimeter is wide, that even with a big crowd, you still get to enjoy the view and take photos of the pavilion. There is path leading to the back, but there really isn’t much to see. The pavilion is the star of the attraction. There are souvenir and snack options inside, and a couple of cafes outside. The place is accessible by bus. Would recommend
