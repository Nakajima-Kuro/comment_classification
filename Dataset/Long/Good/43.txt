Did this tour 2 days ago and highly recommend especially if only in Rio for a couple of days. Get to see the main sites without being too rushed.
Small van. Excellent guide (thank you Priscilla - you were informative, fun and speak fantastic English as well as Spanish)
11 on our tour - but mini bus could take a few more. Nice to be in a small group.
Also had a great driver Luis, who we felt totally safe with.
Bbq lunch was included. Lots of nice salads (buffet) and tender meats carved at the table.
All in all 10/10. Great day, good value.
