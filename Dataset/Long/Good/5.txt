Visited this shrine on arrival at kyoto. Beautiful shrine and immediately embraced the local feel. Crowds were huge but manageable . Would be far better to experience at another time which enabled a more spiritual feel. Lovely food stalls on the way down the street and back to the station and tried loads of interesting local delights.
