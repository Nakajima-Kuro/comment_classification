What can I say? This is a gorgeous, gorgeous basilica. We've been to Rome a couple of times and visiting this church was always a pleasure. I'm pretty sure it has a free entrance which is great! I really encourage all these types of touristic attractions to have free entrance because this also encourages more people to come and enjoy what it has to offer. And I've actually noticed that a bunch have already started which is great! I really adore this basilica because of its architecture that goes from early Christian to the Baroque style. Just keep in note that this building was renovated and restored in the eighteenth century. It is opened every day from 7 am to 6:30 pm. It's not very busy so anytime is perfect to come to visit this beautiful church.
