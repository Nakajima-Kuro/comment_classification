Kinkakuji is really beautiful with the exterior of the two upper floors being completely coated by gold leaves. The entrance fee (400Y) was well worth it. The entrance ticket is a traditional amulet blessed at the shrine.

The amulets sold at Kinkakuji are also more reasonably priced and are very exquisite (embroidered with the golden pavilion).
