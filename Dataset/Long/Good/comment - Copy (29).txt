We took a 9km boat ride through 10 temples and 10 caves. The caves were amazing and the scenery absolutely breath-taking. Go early to avoid the crowds and get a far more serene feel throughout your ride.

Even helped the boatwoman do some rowing. These amazing people earn 200,000 dong per ride and most days they only get one ride. Most of them also do this as a side income. Its not easy work rowing a boatload of people for 9km, so please do tip them generously.
