What can I say Big Ben is a national treasure, the humongous clock has been there all my life letting me know once upon a time when the news was on and when every hour approached, if London lost Big Ben it would be like ripping it’s heart out, Ben is our friend our timekeeper and he watches over us minute after minute second after second hour after hour, I love Ben he’s always been there it would be outrageous for London to ever be without him he’s a landmark he’s unique he’s original he’s our Big Ben.
