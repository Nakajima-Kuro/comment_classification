There are tons of reviews so I will keep it short. We chose trang an over Tam coc because of negative reviews. Trang an is great. Choose any route as they all are beautiful. There is no favourite. Entry fee is 200000 VND for adults and 100000 VND for children. They don't enforce height restrictions for kids strictly. All workers are polite. You should at least tip 50000VND at the end of your trip even though they don't really ask. Enjoy.
