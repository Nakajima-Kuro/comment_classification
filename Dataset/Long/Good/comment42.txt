Actually my trip was October 2018 but that date wasnt in option :)
Once in Paris of course this is top 3 to do. We had VIP guided tour +climb up to 2nd floor. Lines were long so def skip the line is mandatory. Before entering be prepaired to full search. Once u r in, there are lines as well, so again skip the line is a must.Our BigBus guide was great,we learned so many new facts. Extra plus was the tour held at night so the view was great. Recommend to go to trocadero and walk thrue it to get to Effel.right outside of effel u ll find great street food and carosele.
Overall, tower is on time slot and no way u ll be pushed or crumped.
