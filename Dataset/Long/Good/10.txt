The first of all the temples in Kyoto, you should visit. We arrived in the afternoon, at the perfect time to be able to got this beautiful photo: the mirror effect is seen, with the temple reflected in the water. Its walls are covered with gold and surrounded by a beautiful garden, and due the fall season, the colors are beautiful. Visit highly recommended.
