I came to this place in a wet season, which was in effect of a storm nearby. One thing I was pity, I didnt come to the real monument of Dinh Tien Hoang, the King of ƒêinh dynasty, because it needed me to climb on a mountain, which was slippery. So I came to these temples. you dont know how I feel when I saw these. It was respective, ancient and peaceful. If you like history, this will be a best place.
