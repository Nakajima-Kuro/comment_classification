This trip was a great way to see a good bit of Rio. In only a few hours, we visited all of the major tourist attractions and had a traditional Brazilian lunch. We met amazing people from all over the world. The views were spectacular as the weather was very friendly to us. Highly recommended tour. We enjoyed our guide as well. He didn’t ask for a tip, but it would have been good to know what was customary.
