We had tickets for 10.30 and started queuing in a holding line at 10am, we moved onto the tour at 10.20 so at 10.30 we were entering the lift to the summit at 10.30 (so get there 30 mins before your allotted time). The views at the top are amazing, and as it's such an iconic part of Paris it is nice to say we have been up to the top. A few tips, pre book tickets, get there early, wear a hat it's cold at the top, and if you feel up to it, walk back down.
