We booked the the all round tour so we could make the most of this first time trip to Rome. We got to go into the underneath in the dungeons to see where the gladiators came up from to the main floor as well as the animals. There is a mock elevator down there as well as the sewers. We got to step out onto the arena floor and see the underneath before we went down there. The tour guide was very informative and told us all about the different areas of seating that are still just about visible. They are doing a lot of restoration work on the building but you don't overly notice the workmen. After seeing the dungeons etc we went up to the first floor for a better view of the arena. After wandering around this floor, we went up through a locked gate up into the third tier tunnel where we could see the sheer height that people would have been at to watch the performance. And also we could look down to see the box where the roman emperors would have sat. We then went up another smaller flight of stairs to the very top where the views were absolutely stunning. well worth paying the money for. The tour guide was funny and informative. Would definitely recommend.
