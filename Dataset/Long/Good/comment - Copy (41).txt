If you're ever in Paris I recommend visiting this Eiffel tower. It is breathtaking by day and stands out by night when it is all lit up and glows from a distance and close up. It is also nice that such are preserved as monuments for posterity for all to appreciate.

Amazing place to go, specially if you're with a special someone. We visited this place with family and our kind french friends who explained us about the history of Paris. Specially in the evening as you can see the light show. make sure your batteries are fully charged and got lots of room to take pictures and videos on your memory.
