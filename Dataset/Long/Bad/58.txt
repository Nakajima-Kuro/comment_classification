I recently took the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn Heights and DUMBO tour. Our guide for this tour, Onel Alfaro, was a fantastic "real deal" Brooklynite. He was very knowledgeable about the history of the areas we covered. He took a great deal of time with our group, I never felt rushed and loved the group pictures. The cost of this tour was a tip to the guide. I would highly recommend this tour especially with Onel Alfaro.
