The twin towers are a good attraction and a must see for KL. However, what Instagram and social media does not tell you is that you will be harassed by locals to buy photographs and ‘fish eye’ camera lenses for your iPhone.

I don’t mind being asked a few times, but this was constant and everywhere around the towers.
