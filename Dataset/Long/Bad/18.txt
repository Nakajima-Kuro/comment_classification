Any view of the wreath laying ceremony blocked to public by a huge exclusion zone. All we got treated to was lines of ridulously important diplomatic convoys going backwards and forwards all day. Hope the VIPs enjoyed celebrating their own importance as they clearly deserved full credit for ending the war, because the whole thing day nothing to do with the acknowledgment of sacrifice of those pesky military personnel, family and veterans. Ridiculous farce
