As we approached the eiffel tower, we were surrounded by African Street sellers all trying to sell their tourist Chinese crap.

The Eiffel tower has been boxed in by thick bullet proof like glass walls.

It's a sign of times that this once beautiful tourist attraction is nothing more than a sad shaddow of its former glory.
