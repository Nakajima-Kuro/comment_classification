First of all with all the tourists they received each year. They cannot set aside improvements for handicap people.
First going up to the statue had limited usage which the accommodation was never given a priority for the handicap people. They are being abuse by non handicap accommodation. When you complain nothing happened. No offense to the management. Especially using the elevators. So if you disabled forget it even on the side of taking the ferry. Please note for all the handicap people in the world. If you want to take a tour at the statues of liberty forget it. You will definitely be disappointed.
