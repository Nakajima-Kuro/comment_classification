Ok - I have been to Hoi An twice and both times I thought “I can’t wait to leave”. If you like giant outdoor “shopping malls” with way too many people and the nauseating smell of incense combined with cooking fires then visit Hoi An since basically that is what the Hoi An old city (including the night market) has become. It is a shame because it is a lovely setting that has been destroyed by excessive tourism.
