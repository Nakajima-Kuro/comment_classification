Architecturally the bridge is noteworthy for being the first steel-wire suspension bridge, but if you are not interested in architectural history, it's just another bridge.

The walk is slightly elevated in the middle of 6 lanes of constant traffic. If there is little wind, the exhaust fumes of the traffic hang heavy in the air. The walkway is about 6m wide and divided into one half for pedestrians and the other half for bicycles. When I was there, on a Saturday evening, the bridge was absolutely packed with people. The pedestrian part was often blocked by stands, police caddies, and selfie takers. For most of the time the bike lanes are packed with people as well. 80% of the tourists there have no idea what a bike lane is. They walk on it with no regard for anything but their selfie, often not even looking up when bells, sirens or shouts of the passing bicycles are heard. The bicycles, which mostly seem to be battle hardened local commuters, don't care, they go at full speed, most of them constantly yelling. I witnessed several near collisions. Because there are so many people and space is so limited it's constant stop and go and there is constant pushing and after a little while you have only a single wish: To be off that bridge.

You may think now, that with all this craziness there would be one redeeming quality, the view. But you are wrong, while you get an ok view of the Manhattan side, it's partially obstructed by the bridge's structure and the 3 lanes of vehicle traffic on each side will ruin any romantic photo op.

If you are mostly interested in the view, my recommendation is: Don't walk the bridge. Instead take the subway to High St Station and take Middagh St and then Squibb Park Bridge to Brooklyn Bridge Park. Once in the park you can have a relaxing stroll along the water front, with fantastic views of the Manhattan skyline.
