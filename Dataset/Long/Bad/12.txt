Getting on to the island is now hard as nearly all entrances are closed. The police very unhelpful on site. When you do make it, the chaotic with queues. Then we you do get a ticket, the security is a longtime and is not really a check. The walk up the steps is ok but you need to be quite fit. The museum is not good. The view off the top is ok. But not for the hassle.
