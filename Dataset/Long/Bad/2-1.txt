We wanted to visit the Eiffel Tower with our family but were in the end unable to get to Paris because of the national strike. Our request to cancel the tickets several days ahead of our visit was not met; the response was the following: However, as indicated in our email, no cancellation or modification of your tickets is possible” (“Cependant, comme indiqué dans notre email, aucune annulation ou modification de vos billets n’est possible.”).
Not really customer friendly and a huge disappointment
