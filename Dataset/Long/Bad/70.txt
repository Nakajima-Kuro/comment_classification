Asiatique many years ago was one of the most popular night markets to go in Bangkok. There are many other newer and cleaner markets nowadays and Asiatique no longer enjoys its fame as before. Over priced menu and shady vendors, this place has the feel and look of a tourist trap. I am no longer sure it’s worth the time and energy to make your way down here while there are many other great choices.
