I had an awful evening along with my partner here. There were thousands of people and we were st the very front of the people right in front of the arc du triomphe. Crazily there was hardly anyone that was there when we got there but it filled up very fast. I couldn’t wait for the fireworks but the police presence and previous protester problems had disturbed me. There were two barriers of concrete blocks and metal gates that prevented anyone from getting any closer and as it was almost 12 people started to get excited and the news broadcasters were getting the crowds up. Some idiot/idiots/ I don’t know what decided they would start pushing the entire crowd forward so the barriers were shaking. I was in a wheelchair and didn’t notice what was going on until my legs were crushed against the barrier and people started shouting. It was awful and nobody did anything. Men started climbing over us to get out because they were being pushed and the only way to go was into the police as there were thousands behind us. Eventually it became too much of a risk and my partner and a kind French man had to lift me over the two gates and also two kids. I have no idea what happened to everyone else but by that time some people were really scared at the front and were crying. The police tried to stop us from getting over but we ignored them to then find that all the nearby tube stations were closed and we had a seven mile walk back to the hotel despite being told by police and other staff around that they would be open. To sum up it was a terrifying evening and I really really wouldn’t recommend going there with that amount of people. I know some people had a great time but for me it’s something that me nor my partner will ever forget.
