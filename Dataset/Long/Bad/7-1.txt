Do not book tickets on the official Eiffel Tower ticketing site!

I attempted to book 2 summit tickets last week, the system took my payment but I didn't get sent any tickets via email.

After I noticed this I called their customer support team and was told that I would have to send a copy of my passport and a bank statement for proof of payment in order to simply get my money back.

This feels like a scam - they took my payment, had no intentions of sending me the tickets and weren't even going to inform me about the mistake.
