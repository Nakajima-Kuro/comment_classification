Very confusing setup—the entrance wasn’t clearly marked and of course we went to the wrong side first and then stood at the wrong line at the right side. The lines were long and the levels were crowded even on a rainy day we went. Still, we were impressed by the magnificent structure, and by the views it afforded.
