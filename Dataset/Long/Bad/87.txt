We got to this place excited that we’re going to see some amazing history and culture but right at the door I’ve been treated so badly by the doorman just because I was not wearing long pants.

My partner was exactly the same but I’ve been forced to go and get a dirty scarf to put around me just because I’m a woman but men can go in however they want.

I found it very offensive that in this time and age they still treat people this way.

This left a sour taste in my mouth and didn’t really enjoy the temple.
