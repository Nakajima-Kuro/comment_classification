Ok so maybe I'm a tad jaded..I am a New Yorker and because of this I am naturally suspicious of offers made especially one to see GREAT ATTRACTRACTIONS!
The Statue of Liberty is a must see..however only you can gauge how much of a "must see" it really is.First of all know YOU CAN NOT GO INSIDE UNLESS YOU GO ON THE WEB SITE AND GO THROUGH A VERY VERY VERY METICULOUS TSA PASSPORT TYPE OF INVESTIGSTION. hey understandable..you have to know who is going inside one of the most beloved icons in the World!
And managing this feat have alarm alerts remind you cos tickets go faster than a melted mashmellow..one blink and you are stuck like most buying a ticket from the site or a vendor to have the p,secure of standing outside framing you're neck for 90 minute loo,ing upward at..well THE STATUE.
I'd tell you there are p,entry of more pleasant ways to spend your hard earned buck and see more!
Go to any of the multitude of sight seeing boat trips around New York for roughly the same price and see everything.
Or go on the beloved STATEN ISLAND FERRY AND SEE THE STATUE OF LIBERTY FOR FREEEEEE
