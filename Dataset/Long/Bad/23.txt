I‘d been to Hoi An four years ago. Although it was already a bit touristy at this time, it was still laid back and I loved it.
That‘s why I returned there on this trip. Unfortunately the old town is now overcrowded with tourists and coffee shops. The street vendors are quite annoying and follow you to make you buy stuff. They now even bother you while you are sitting in a restaurant or a coffee shop and try to sell you something. I was really a bit disappointed and regretted coming back. What a pity, it used to be such a nice place.
