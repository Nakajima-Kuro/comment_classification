BEWARE! As we were approached the area where you take a boat to the Statue of Liberty, we were accosted by a man in an official looking vest selling tickets for an express boat tour. He told us that the regular queue was so long that it would take hours for a ticket but that his tour would only take an hour. When we still hesitated, he pointed to the heavy police presence and said that guaranteed his validity. What a mistake!
We were ushered, with many other suckers, towards a side street and told to wait for a bus. After 45 minutes we finally got onto a bus and were then put through a terrible 50 minute drive through the Lincoln Tunnel into New Jersey. We were dropped off in a run down yacht harbour with no one in sight and no explanation. Many people gave up and left but we were determined to see if a boat would actually turn up. Well, after 75 minutes, a run down old former paddle steamer arrived and we boarded with some trepidation. There was no landing but only a close look at the Statue before we returned to harbour.
We were told that buses were coming but looking at the crowd and the potential delay and long return journey we decided, along with several others, to return to Manhattan by public transport. This cost us $8.25 and the total of this con was therefore $48.25 plus the loss of an entire afternoon. Unbelievable!
Do not fall for these con artists but queue for the regular boats to Liberty Island instead.
