Absolute madness, before going up the tower family in front of me has several weapons seized including a 8 inch machete style skeng and several pepper sprays. Paid good Money so still opted to go up the tower. The lift was sketchy man and must be some malfunction in there because my ears popped! Very crowded and I believe due to the weight on the structure it slightly wobbled. Still made the decision to go to the top. Almost bottled it in the lift when a bird flew into it. And the wind up top meant I lost my beanie which a looky looky man sold me on the way in. Didn’t enjoy it nothing to write home about. I advise the city to take it down and build some homes to sort the homeless problem. Highly commercialised and bigged up to much by the missus.
