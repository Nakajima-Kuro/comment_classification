After arriving at the local bus station from Da Nang we were overcharged by the bike taxi to our hotel. I'd advise others to take Grab instead.

Riverside eatery asked us to pay and forced us to leave even though we were still eating, although there weren't any other customers waiting!

Too many tourists at the old town and and even though it's supposed to be a walking street, tricycles were all honking people to get out of their way!
