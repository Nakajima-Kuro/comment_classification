Me and my girlfriend visited the Eiffel Tower on 08/12/19. We had prebooked tickets for 11am. When we got there we was informed due to weather the top floor would be closed.

A ground staff member informed us that we would receive a automatic refund for the price difference of going to the top floor. That is what always happens when the top floor is closed due to bad weather and we shouldn’t worry about getting a refund.

However after arriving home and contacting them we were informed that they were able to grant access to the top floor two hours after our time slot so they “are unable to respond favourably to your refund”.

We paid for a time slot and was unable to access the top floor due to weather conditions and we appreciate safety comes first. However the issue is we were lied to by your ground staff in regards to the refund.

We feel like you have stolen our money and lied to us. If we were informed that we were able to come back at a later date we would of however we were lied to by your ground staff and feel like we have been cheated and robbed. Terrible service.
