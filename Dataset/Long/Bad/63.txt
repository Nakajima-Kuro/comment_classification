I just have to say, that we normally get into this Wat, and then cover for the reclining Buddha. I did not have the proper attire, and they wouldn't even let us in the main gate. We were not going for the Buddha, as we have done so many times before. Although we love it, we were just taking friends to see the grounds. There wasn't any place to 'Rent" clothes, without leaving your passport..I said i was not comfortable leaving my passport and they pointed to cameras. Right, i am going to leave my passport. I was not scantly dressed, by any means, but AT THE GATES..so we did not get to even go in, and i wish i would have known.
