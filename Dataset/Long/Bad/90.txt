Do not waste time and money to go up there. Its not worth the penny.

This is the most over rated attraction I have been to till date.

They have no valid reason that why did they built it and what is the significance.

No doubt it looks way too pretty and is really eye catchy.

So do get a lot of pictures clicker in front of it and save your money by not going up.
