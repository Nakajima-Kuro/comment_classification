I am an Indian who visited Krabi and Bangkok with a couple of friends .No doubt Krabi is a beautiful place with very warm people,but Bangkok is an entirely different place with regards to respect to fellow humans. The shop keepers passed open racist comments commenting on our color especially in ASIATIQUE !!! Very dissappointed with an international destination like Bangkok..please be prepared if you want to visit
