The Brooklyn Bridge should not be crossed with a bike. There is a bike lane, but tourists walk in the lane and block it. We spent majority of time stopping because of people taking selfies in the bike lane. We ended up walking our bikes back over the bridge to return. It was very frustrating and really not enjoyable. If tourists would respect the bike lane, this may have been a lot better.
