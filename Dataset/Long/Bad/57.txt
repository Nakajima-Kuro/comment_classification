I'd say thousands of people walk the bridge every day during summer. It is super congested - an absolute nightmare. And you have to beware the cyclists, some going at high speed. I was looking across to the Manhattan Bridge that is several hundred yards away. There were very few people walking this bridge and it has pretty much the exact same view. Too late for me but have a think about avoiding this tourist trap if you want a more relaxing experience.
