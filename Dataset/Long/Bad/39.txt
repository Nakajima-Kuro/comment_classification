You are herded like sheep from the moment you arrive. Made to queue for hours in the open in 35 degree heat as it is far too busy and uncontrolled. Everywhere is busy - the queues, the ferry, the island! We spent more time queuing than actually being on the island and going up the statue! We went up to the pedestal and it was all for a less than overwhelming view. Do yourself a favour and don't bother!
