My boyfriend as well as a female were hospitalised and a handful of other hurt in a violent attack in hoi an. He bled out from the head wound was black and blue on his body and and could have died if not for two tourists on the street that found him running away and passing out covered in blood. A local headbutted a girl when she asked for her change that he refused to give back and when people went to help her a host of guys came in with metal pole / make shift weapons etc and started attacking all the tourists there. Be careful when in this area. Have your wits about you. If they go to rip you off don't question it or get mouthy accept the loss
