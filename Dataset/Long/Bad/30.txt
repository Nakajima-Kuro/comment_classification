Hoi An was once a gorgeous, laid back little town but today it is completely overrun by tourists. It has changed so much over the last 10 years and is hardly recognisable. Salespeople are still friendly but along the waterfront they are very pushy and it’s a bit overwhelming. The sheer number of people in the streets was really unpleasant, we didn’t bother to stay for dinner. It’s disappointing to see, it was not at all enjoyable. We went in the early evening and will try again at a quieter time of day. I hope the small local businesses are benefitting from the tourists because it would be sad to see the town overrun for nothing.
