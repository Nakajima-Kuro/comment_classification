When visiting the Eiffel Tower we struggled to walk 15 feet without being stopped and tried to be sold some sort of junk by illegal street vendors. The area feels incredibly unsafe during the day, I wouldn’t even be game to be around at night.

When walking with my partner 3-4 of these vendors tried to separate us forming a wall between us in order to get money for string bracelets we said we didn’t want.

When on earth will the French government do something about this. I would not recommend Paris to anyone until the can sort these people out.
