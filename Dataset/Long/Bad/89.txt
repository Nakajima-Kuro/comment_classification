Yesterday we wisited the tower and firstly stoped to the bridge for 10 minutes to take fotos. There was nothing special, because it was very, very cold because of air conditioning. The windows were humid and we didn't see enything and it wasn't good for pictures. Then we went to the top and stay there for 10 minutes to look around. Not much to see frought the windows. Ok, I can say I was there, bat that us all.
