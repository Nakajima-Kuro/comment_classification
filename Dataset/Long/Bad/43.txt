What a waste of time. I reserved the tickets 2 months in advance which was only enough to get the ferry - no crown access or pedestal access available either. Having reserved early really gave us. Wry little advantage... the reserved queue merged in to the general queue quite quickly. Consequently it took over an hour from our arrival at the port to Getto the Statue. Once we did it took 10 minutes to see what we came to see after which we spent another hour queuing up to get back to the Manhattan. To increase the frustration a ferry turned up, disembarked it’s passengers and then left almost empty, leaving us to wait another 20 minutes for the next ferry. Children going crazy with boredom.

Suggest you download a picture and photoshop yourselves in to it, and use the time to do anything else... plenty of great experiences in New York which are a better use of your time.
