My husband and I were booked on a two hour cruise a couple of days ago. We waited an hour and a half after the schedule departure to be told it was cancelled because the captain was new and not confident in bringing the boat into a different dock. We had in addition to take a taxi to the ferry station which cost eleven dollars because the website gave us the wrong location.

The next morning we eventually persuaded someone at the ferry to let us onto the cruise that had been cancelled the day before. We had paid for a two hour cruise only to find out that they only go out for an hour.

I wrote at least a dozen times to complain but was told they weren’t prepared to do anything. Appalling treatment and false advertising.

My husband and I are both seventy years old and it was very difficult to be standing all that time !! We are visiting from Australia.
