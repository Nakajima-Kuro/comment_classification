Visited this temple along with the other temples around the immediate area and the Grand Palace in one day, that’s about all you’d need. However, to get to this temple you need a boat transfer so we got into a Toktok and told him to take us to a port. All the ports are private and we got ripped off for 3000 bhat to take us to the temple (5 minute ride), wait there (20 minutes) and take us to a floating market around the area for another (30 minutes) giving it a 1 hour return trip. There was no floating market and the immediate area was filthy and rubbish it was the worst spent money in the entire trip! Transfers by reputable companies wouldn’t cost more than 60 bhat for unlimited journeys for that day per person so keep an eye out for the conmen! In any event, it was that of a great temple I wouldn’t put extra effort into visiting it you wouldn’t miss much if you pass.
