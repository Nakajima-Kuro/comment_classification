I was about to buy the tickets at the counter and looking for a 18-25 prices tickets, with a discount offered by my paris visite pass.

The man charged me with the full adult ticket, which is slightly more expensive than the young ticket, and I told him that I need the 18-25 young ticket.

He, with the rudest way a customer service can give, said:
"Show me what you have?!!!"

Then I show him my copy of passport.
"Do you have a visa? You know what a visa is like right???" He yelled at me.

Unlucky for me that time that I left my passport at my hotel because I don't know that I need to show my visa?? Since the only thing they need to check for the ticket is my birthdate??

I told him that I didn't bring my visa and I'm ok to pay the full adult price. But he insisted that I have to show him my visa and said "I will ******* give you the ticket for free if you can show me your visa"

I said "free?? What do you mean?"
He said "if you chinese can show me your visa from china I give you ticket upstairs for free"

One thing just in case you, the rude ticket counter man, read this "yes I am asian but I am not from china. Even if I am from China, you have no right to do such racist stereotyping against one racial identity. I wouldn't be able to stand right in front of you, here in france, if I don't have any visa with me - like if the airport immigration officer don't even bother?"

I didn't go upstairs + this is not the only attraction you can have in paris. If it happens that you encounter this kind of service, don't bother to just leave and find something else to see, there's too much of a good attractions outside the arc.
