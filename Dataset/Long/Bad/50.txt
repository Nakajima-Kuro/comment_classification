Enjoy a nice stroll with 10,000 of your new closest friends. This is the one thing we wished we’d skipped. It was body to body, shoulder to shoulder walking across this bridge. Hard to breathe let alone take a picture. People were pushing and jostling for position, bikes were struggling to weave through and squeeze by. We remarked the only thing worse than trying to walk the bridge would have been trying to bike it. Poor folks. We had four kids. 5,9,12,15, they managed fine, the youngest was in a small stroller which helped. I think we could have lost her otherwise. Water was cheap- $1 vendors, that was good. As soon as we crossed back over we breathed a sigh of relief. We took a city line cruise a few days later and got awesome views and photographs of the bridge.
