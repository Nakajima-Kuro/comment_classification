I purchased the tickets via trip advisor and then received the reservation detail from VIATOR, BUT unfortunately the tickets that were supposed to be used March 16 were NOT needed since it was a protest in Paris and the Arc was closed. I been trying to get a refund since this was not used or even reschedule by the company with zero success.

I had purchased other tickets for the same time frame from other places and I got the email saying that it was a protest and to make sure I don’t lose the $ they can reschedule but not from this one nor I had received an email with my request on my refund.
