Actually shocked by what happened today ( Saturday 11th may ) at the Arc de Triomphe, I wanted to take my friend up there to see the views of Paris for her birthday. When we arrived downstairs there was a really long queue so we decided to order some off-line which allowed us to skip the queue and go straight up, When we got up To Security our Tickets weren’t working We was told to stand over there and wait so we did so I was standing there another couple came up to the security man with the same tickets that we had from the same company and they didn’t work yet they was allowed in so we thought while we were waiting there we would be allowed in at any second However a couple of minutes go past and another security guard is telling us to leave he then takes us downstairs back to the box office where he tells us to show them our tickets and he is told they’re not working he then tells us to go away it’s not his problem whilst shewing us with his hand, me and Lucy both being very confused as we have paid for these tickets through a trusted google website ask what’s the problem where again we are told to go away and call the ticket people it’s not our problem to which in agitation we say “ that’s so f***ing rude” the man then says “f**k you, f**k you” we end up trying again with another set of tickets from the website that we was resent to find 5 other people having the same problem and the tickets still not working, we got escorted back down to the same ticket man where he refused to serve us and give us a ticket as we had been rude and not respectful?! This is a lovely landmark ruined by horrible staff who instead of helping chose to make us feel unwelcome. Other people in the que who witnessed it tried buying tickets for us knowing we was in no way in the wrong and didn’t need to be spoken to like that and his supervisor ( I’m assuming) ended up serving us the tickets however thought she should tell us we should apologise which we refused to do on the basis that he was rude first for no reason.
