Ended up very disappointed. We got there a little late, about 10:30, because I got caught at work. By that time the line just to get tickets was over an hour. By the time we got our tickets, the line for the ferries was literally the length of battery park. We ended up just leaving. We thought we might go back another day but decided it wasn't worth it.

I wouldn't even bother trying to visit the island without reserve tickets. The tickets we ended up with for our trouble weren't even for crown access. And this was *with* a CityPass. The whole thing was a huge waste of time and came pretty close to ruining our day
