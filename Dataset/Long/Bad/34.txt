Maybe years ago it was a charming place, now we cant find anything charming, or even, interesting here. Seems like a fake town.

The ancient town its like a massive mall full of tourists and shops with overpriced aliexpress products (you Can find same things in Hanoi or Saigón 10 times cheaper)

The museums and houses to visit dont worth it.

By far worst place in our Schedule. A place to skip
