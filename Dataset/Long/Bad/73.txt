Gorgeous location with great shopping enviroment. Has a night market with mostly great vendors. We did experince this this vendor selling food that tried to rip us off. We bought some food and while he was cooking I paid him. Cost was 200 baht. I gave him a note for 1000 baht and was waiting for my change. Instead 3 minutes later he gives me the food and asks me to pay him the 200. He even started to get mad and kind of hostile. Instead I pointed out t o camera and asked him to review. 20 mins later he said sorry and gave me 800 back. The food was cold and I quietly took my money and left the food on his table and left. I think this was not the first time it had happened as there were many people in the booth that saw me give the money but all were saying I didnt. I am attaching a picture of the booth.
