StatueCruises.com and the National Park Service have terrible customer service, and terrible, or non-existent signage.
Finding directions to the ferry dock on google maps isn't easy and the website link to the the map does not work. Nobody cares.

Once there, finding the right parking lot ($7) is not easy (no signs until you see it, but lots of red herrings) and is a long, hard, hot walk for grandmas and grandkids. Nobody cares.

People are herded on and off ferries with long lines and waits in the sun. Nobody cares.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, pedestal access closes promptly at 5:00pm, leaving no time to walk from the ferry dock, while the park stays open till 6:45. There is NO SIGNAGE anywhere for this, just a little fine print on your e-ticket. Nobody cares.
Arrive at 5:01? Nobody cares. Crying 8 year old, seeing people walking around on the pedestal while she is denied access? Nobody cares.

Upon leaving with a weeping child, the original access is closed and you have to figure out to leave in another direction. No signage. Nobody cares.
