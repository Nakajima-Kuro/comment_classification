Got stung by the operators of the Queen of Hearts. How stupid do I feel! If somebody comes over to you pretending to be selling official tickets tell him to f@&k off. Go and find yourself the REAL tickets located at castle Clinton.

I got stung. 80 dollars for two of us. Bundled into a beat up bus. Witnessed a fight between the conmen. Took an hour away to NJ. Left to wait by the shore for an hour. Took out eventually on the Queen of Heats boat. Promised we’d be able to get off the boat to take pics. No chance of that!

Avoid at all costs!!!!
