one of the worse expirences on my trip! guarantee a “luxury boat”, this boat is anything but luxury. broken seats, crazy high prices, crappy food, and the longest lines. i was promised a 10 minute bus wait and a 15 minute shuttle ride. i had to wait in a line for 45 minutes just to get on the shuttle, and a 30 minute shuttle ride to Jersey City. Once we get off the boat we have to make a line and wait for 40 more minutes just to get back on a bus to get back to NYC. All boat employees are very kind but that’s the only positive. Sales people in NYC are very misleading this is a scam!!
