The main attraction of the temple is basically the reclining Buddha and nothing else. Came here with my friends (without guide) and we had to pay 200 THB per person (~7USD) for entrance fee. To be honest, paying that amount is not worth it. You can use that amount and go over to the other side and visit Wat Arun (only 50 THB entrance fee).
