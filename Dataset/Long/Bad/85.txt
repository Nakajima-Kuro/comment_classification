Have been to SakonNakon and NakokPanom and love the trip. First Sakon the most worthwhile moment was to pay respect to ??????????? Lueng Pu Mun ...once we arrived in the wast area, it was quite respective and felt the goodness frequency around there. ....... Had dinner in a good steak restaurant that walked back to the hotel. Realizing that the town was very peaceful unlike others. Early in the morning we rushed into ?????? Khong River (Nakon Panom) to provide food to monks. This was impressive because it was very early in morning before sunrise. A lot of people were there awaiting for monks at wat Mahatat , monks walked in row ( as in LuangPrabang) , after that we walked along bank of Khong, very breezy and comfortable feeling. The second day we went to pay respect LuengPu Fun ??????? with similar sacret moment . Evening had dinner by Khong River and walked along walking street of NakokPanom, WoW sooo good indeed. Pl come , no hesitation and trip in Isan in rainy season is the best of the year. Believe me
