The temple is beautiful and worth the visit. But when I went to purchase two tickets at 50 baht each, I handed the sales person 1000 baht note. She handed me the tickets but no change. I told her that I gave her a 1000 but she said I had handed her a 100. At that point I started doubting myself and had no way to prove it one way or the other. When I got back to our hotel I checked and I was missing the money.
