My wife and I were celebrating our 16th year anniversary in Bangkok, Thailand. While we were in the Asiatique Riverfront Warehouse Night Mall we were approached by Mr. Suraj with Victoria Suits to have a tailored suit made.
I will never buy again from Mr. Suraj with Victoria Suits. I also want any other potential shoppers to be aware of Mr. Suraj's behavior with us. Our experience with Mr. Suraj was the only negative experience we had on our vacation/anniversary in Bangkok, Thailand.
Mr. Suraj did not give me what I paid for by shipping through Thai Post Office instead of DHL as he promised. Our clothes took six weeks to arrive in the U.S. My pants were SKINNY LEG pants after I repeated several times "DO NOT MAKE" skinny leg pants.
