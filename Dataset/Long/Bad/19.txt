We bought tickets online ahead of time and arrived at around 10pm. It closes at 11 and the last group allowed to enter is at 10:15. When we arrived, they said they’d already closed and wouldn’t let us up. They gave us a few excuses about why and shut the lights off in the office. There were a bunch of other people there that also didn’t get to go up. Since it was our last day in Paris, we weren’t able to use the tickets and they wouldn’t give us a refund.
