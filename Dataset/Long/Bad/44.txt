I totally love New York City and I've been there many times.....but I did not enjoy my trip to the Statue of Liberty.

I love exploring history and all that....however the slow, cramped, cumbersome climb to the top of the corkscrew-type stairway leading to the top of the Statue is over-rated, in my humble opinion.

Very crowded. Very slow. Once you reach the top, there's really nothing there to reward your patience. People squshed next to you, virtually pushing you forward.

No thanks. Once is enough for me.
