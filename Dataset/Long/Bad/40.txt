The statue of lady Liberty is simply amazing and only thing worth visiting on the island. Now the bad - Statue Cruises which runs the ships from NY is simply terrible. The ships are overcrowded, unpunctual and take forever to unload and load. I have been in line for the past 20 minutes writing this and the incoming boat is still unloading. Add another 20 minutes to load the outbound boat. There are hordes of miserable people in line, literally thousands. The staff are not the least understanding, just interested in cramming people in like cattle.

My advice is to get a good camera and take pictures of the statue from the comfort of the Staten Island Ferry. Avoid wasting 20 bucks on this awful operation
