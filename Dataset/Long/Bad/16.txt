Today, December 1, 2018 the Arc d’Triomphe was trashed by violent protest that was nothing short of an all out riot. This was not a typical strike to cause inconvenience. This was violent protest, 4 to 5 miles of the core city center engulfed in tear gas and the French news reporting over 167 fires. It was impossible to travel across the Seine, over or under. No taxi, no Metro, no walking. This is the third week of such “yellow vest” protest and there is no indication that it will stop. Although they claim it is non-violent, I personally witnessed a mob, wearing yellow vests, attack an old man near Rue Saint Honore which is an exclusive shopping district. This isn’t isolated protest in some remote ethnic slum. The core city center including the star tourist attractions are affected. It is not stable, save your money and wait till the unrest settles.
