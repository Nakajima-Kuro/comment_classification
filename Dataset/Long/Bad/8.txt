Absolutely filled with disgrace and frustration at the appalling treatment I received from the staff here today. Arrived at the attraction and queued for over an hour and then when we finally reached the ticket booths I was charged for a ticket (which is free if you’re under 25) even though I’m 17 years of age.. anyone can see I’m not 25! I don’t think that it is unreasonable to not carry a passport around a city all day everyday! Furthermore, after offering other forms of ID- birth certificate and an ehic card- they still refused. To top things off the staff laughed and made jokes, claiming they are 14 years of age. This not only ruined my day but made me feel very uncomfortable. A shame to ruin what could’ve been an amazing experience of Paris
