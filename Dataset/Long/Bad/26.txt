As with most tourist traps, there is the crowds to contend with. There was some nice spots around the town and some nice places to eat and drink like Bale well and The Espresso shop just on the edge of town. Most shops in the town itself is selling typical "souvenirs". Particularly annoying to go to a place and be hussled by (presumably) locals trying to hussle the very people (tourists) they rely on for business. We were stoped and ask to pay random people for "access" which is not required and when challenged they left or moved on.. I wont return to this place nor recommend it to a single person.
