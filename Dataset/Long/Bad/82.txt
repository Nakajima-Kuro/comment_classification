It's interesting architecture, a fast walk about, and it's easy and cheap to cross the river to reach the other temples. But in comparison to the Grand Palace and Wat Pho, this temple frankly isn't in the same league. You cannot go inside, and if you're afraid of heights, you may struggle with the steep steps (there is nothing to hold onto going up or down).

In fairness, I recommend visiting with a guide if you can. We did not, and maybe we would have found it more meaningful with historical context. There was one, unhelpful educational sign to reference, so we depended entirely on our Lonely Planet book to explain the site's significance, and well, the result is a 2 star rating.
