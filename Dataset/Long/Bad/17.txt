We booked online only to arrive to find the monument was shut due to a strike. The only information that stated this was a tiny little banner on a small TV nearby the ticket booth. Disappointed as it was our last day in Paris, we returned to our hotel to read the terms and conditions which said to email a particular email address with proof that you cannot visit again. I sent all information I had - flights out of Paris, passport information proving we are tourists, bank account details etc. This was all completed the day we wanted to visit - October 2nd.

I have received no response or acknowledgement from this email address, and communication with the general customer service department has only resulted in snarky sounding "it can take several weeks" responses. As of writing this (November 29th) it has been 8 weeks since I applied for a refund and I am STILL waiting.

Will not give up until I receive a full refund, and while I am sure the view from the top is beautiful I cannot recommend a visit.
