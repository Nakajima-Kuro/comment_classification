Beautiful and dazzling Golden Pavilion!
Kinkakuji is really beautiful with the exterior of the two upper floors being completely coated by gold leaves. The entrance fee (400Y) was well worth it. The entrance ticket is a traditional amulet blessed at the shrine.

The amulets sold at Kinkakuji are also more reasonably priced and are very exquisite (embroidered with the golden pavilion).
